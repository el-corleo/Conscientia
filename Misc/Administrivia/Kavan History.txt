Current Landscape at the time of Rikharr

The Single System
	- Established some 300 years before the present, nearly 200 years after Biracul appeared to establish Kavu
	- Dazilan reinterpretation of the Biraculian system
	- Stresses that a single, chosen family should rule in perpetuity - a simulacrum of Biracul's role as Conscientia's sole Voice
	- Adopted by Tambul nearly 100 years later when Dazil's mage's daughter Khalli marries Tambul's mage
	- Has led to extreme stratification in the two contingents
		- Artisans/Builders in Dazil:
			- Only an Artisan's children will receive an Artisan's education
			- A Builder's children are put to work at age 7 and choose to learn either their father or their mother's trade
			- No social mobility
			- Cannot leave the contingent to join another contingent
		- Gleebringers/Cultivators in Tambul:
			- Gleebringers are entertainers (song, dance, music, plays)
			- Cultivators maintain food production
			- No social mobility
			- Cannot leave the contingent to join another contingent
			
Keepers of the Flame
	- Tacribians have several roles:
		- Scholars maintain the Muninn, host foreign magi, plumb the depths of the Archives for new findings (there are so many memories that even after 500 years, they have been unable to sift through it all)
			- Among them are those with different specialties: Alchemists (Doctors/Chemists), Technicians (Mage trainers), Ideologues (Historians/Theologians), and the Archivists (Muninn specialists)
			- Librarians all live and study as Scholars in Tacriva and must choose a specialty
		- Frontiersmen scout the frontier near the Wasteland after draugs began appearing in some of the mining tunnels beneath the Wasteland, many stay in the Sun Tower for lengthy periods to monitor Draug activity
			- Several mines have been abandoned and intentionally caved in due to draug infiltrations
		- Gatherers collect resources, such as ore from the mines, lumber from the forests, herbs from the plains
	- They are more a monastic order than the Enclave, as they are deeply religious
		- Their day is divided into four segments
			- Awareness Wakes	[A.Wake]	(6 a.m.: rise, pray, eat)
			- Awareness Halted	[A.Halt]	(12 p.m.: pray, eat)
			- Awareness Rests	[A.Rest]	(6 p.m.: pray, eat, sing/play)
			- Awareness Warns	[A.Warn]	(10 p.m.: pray, sleep)
		
The First Muninn
	- This is the first Muninn tree in existence
	- It is connected to all other Muninns and the Thought Wheels in the Sanctuary, Wellspring and Urrugh
	- It survived the Punishing Wars between the Thiuda and Ataraxia
	- It's responsible, in tandem with the Thought Wheels, for maintaining an idyllic climate for the Jenowin Plain
		- Lush green grass, myriad wildflowers, forests, lakes, and plenty of wildlife can survive on the Jenowin Plain thanks to this set up
		- The edge of its influence is simply called the Edge and essentially stops at the Duskfangs and the Crescent Canyon
		
People
	- Rikos, Librarian:
		- Son of Drakharr (Drakos) and next in line to be mage
		- Specializing as an Archivist
	- Ark, Librarian:
		- Daughter of Builder, but adopted by Rikos' uncle when her father died in an accident in the Wellspring (He died protecting Rikos' uncle from..?)
			- As a result spent a lot of time with Rikos growing up and is very close to him
		- Received an Artisan's education despite her origins and is now studying as a Librarian because of her strong Techne affinity (significantly stronger than Rikos')
		- Specializing as a Technician
	- Ydarys, Mage of Tambul:
		- Been mage of Tambul for 20 years
		- Has 5 grown children still training as Librarians in Tacriva
		- Specialized as an Archivist, Techician, Ideologue, and Alchemist (the first in history to achieve mastery of all subjects; considered the single greatest genius in Kavan history; named the Emerald Mage as a joke about her knowledge)
		- Wants to rule over Kavu (the logical progression of the Single System is to unite under a single mage)
		- Plots to sabotage the Muninn and then repair it (an idea inspired by a tale given to her from a traveling Mage named Lazham, with a charming wide-brimmed rust-colored hat nearly 10 years ago)
			- Convinces the Tacribian mage council to give Dazil and Tambul saplings (might try to get Rikos in on it to give legitmacy to the request) and uses that opportunity to exploit a little known weakness in the Muninn
	- Doamis, High Mage of Tacriva:
		- Specialist in Alchemy
		- Staunch proponent of the Old Ways, of staying true to the original Biraculian system
		- Fond of Rikos and Ark, a mentor to both
		- Suspects Drakos' death was unnatural and asks Rikos to look at the remains in the Wellspring (in the Chamber of Bones, to see if there are traces of poison)
