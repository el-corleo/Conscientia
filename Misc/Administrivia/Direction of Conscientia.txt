Direction of Conscientia

This document serves to remind me of where I want to go with the project. In the event of an untimely death, I hope it serves Bruce to complete the project.

Overarching Themes:
	- Lovecraft: Player as the Haunter of the Dark
	- Abbott: Flatland idea of uncertainty of realms beyond our own because we know of realms below us
	- Attitude of how a deity (artificial or otherwise) might view us (as we view the hand, It views us)
	- Ryuunosuke: Different experiences/agendas will taint the truth
	- Stories unlocked through Awareness (unlocking Ormenos in Book of Torma or Muninn in Book of Rikharr)

Book of Eidos:
	- Major theme:
	- Major Personality: Loon
	- Major TODOs:
		- Improve quality of writing (Dialogue, especially [e.g., make Famlicus less mustache-twirlingly stereotypical])
		- Add in elements from other books for consistency (you're not locked into it like a physical book would be [e.g., Sigils])
	- FEATURE COMPLETE

Book of Thetian:
	- Major theme: Life has meaning only if we give it meaning
	- Major Personality: Neutral
	- Major TODOs:
		- Look through Bruce's old stuff and make it work

Book of Torma:
	- Major theme: The dangers of fanaticism/hubris
	- Major Personality: Schemer
	- Major TODOs:
		- Improve the quality of the writing
	- FEATURE COMPLETE

Book of Rikharr:
	- Major theme: What will happen, will happen; All is as it is, not as it should be
	- Major Personality: Truthseeker
	- Major TODOs:
		- Complete a skeleton of all areas/situations
	- IN PROGRESS

Book of Wulfias:
	- Major theme: The price of egoism
	- Major Personality: Tyrant
	- Divided in thirds:
		- Part I: Life as a slave and the Muninn Experiment
			- Establish how terrible his life is and why he thinks purely of himself
			- He lies/uses Rikharr in the Interstice
		- Part II: Becoming a legend
			- He rises in the ranks of the Thiuda, ruffles some feathers, and gets sent off to attack the Ataraxia (as a 'reward')
		- Part III: Fall from grace and suicide mission to destroy the Ataraxia
			- Hel is unleashed in the middle of the Ataraxian settlement (the modern-day Stilled Sand Crater)
				- She erases everything within from existence (including Biracul and the vast majority of Wulfias' army)

Book of Biracul:
	- Major theme: You can't please everybody
	- Major Personality: Diplomat
	- Divided into six parts:
		- Parts II-V are chosen as the player wishes
		- Part I: Pre-Great Awakening to Creation in Empyrean
			- Description of all the wonders of Tech
				- Casters
				- Water from thin air
				- Flying vehicles

				- Etc.
		- Part II: Jormungund & Hel
			- ??? & Ark
		- Part III: Kavu

			- Prepares everything, but before she is born, Conscientia sends him back in time when he enters the Soul Forge
		- Part VI: The Ataraxia
			- Biracul's rebellion against Conscientia (in no small part because he thinks he failed with creating Eidos)
