Book of Biracul Outline

Pre-Awakening Discussion of Conscientia
	- Some details regarding the Four Jinetes and their relationship with Viracocha
	- Debating whether or not to turn the machine on
	- Viracocha is part of a anti-Tech militant group, come to sabotage the Conscientia facilities, and accidentally flips the switch

Instant of Awakening
Born
	- If Torma birthed you
	- No communication with Conscientia, but feels divinely impelled with a righteous mission from the Creator
	- Sent in form to Zemes, Jer, or Kavu

Zemes
	- Everything is a barren waste, the End of Times draws near, no humans remain, starless sky
	- The Red Tower & Stone Circle
		- Cryptic message about how his Daughter (Eidos) will birth the universe of her womb (the Red Tower itself) after the Slave Mage spills your blood as seed to make the Tower sprout.
		- A woman w/ braided hair, a simple shirt, breeches and a red traveling road is seen from afar making her way to the entrance
	- Before he can speak to the woman, he is sent to Jer or Kavu

Wrangling of the Wyrm
	- Bind Jormungund & get local Biraculian priests to watch over it
		- Wrangles the Wyrm and asks if they know anything about Eidos, tells them she is important
	- Gets sent to Kavu or Zemes from Stone Circle (hidden by fog in Torma)

Imprisoning Hel
	- Bind Hel to Ark & lock away in Dungeon of the Void
	- Asks Ark about Eidos as they journey to Urrugh
		- Ark learns the Shining One is just a man, but still decides to trust in the will of Awareness, we learn about her feelings for Rik(?)
		- Ark also laments the misuse of tech that led to Rik's demise, Bir suggests fighting against it, Ark says that that's impossible, it WILL occur as part of the natural order of things (evolution seeks perfection); the best thing we can do is figure out how to keep it from harming up; use it as a weapon? No. Become allies with it, seek common ground and work together.
			- Weak(?) But goal is to get Viracocha to come around on the whole anti-Tech thing and decide to work w/ Vanargand to stop Conscientia by creating something to transcend it
	- Sent to Enclave

Enclave
	- Approaches Vanargand, but needs to convince him
		- Tell him about the missions to wrangle his spawn (questions arise as to whether they were truly missions or misguided fancies on Viracocha's part)
		- Vanargand suggests a method of containing Conscientia w/ Fenrir, but says that his plans all fall apart at not being able to access Conscientia
		- Viracocha remembers the message about Eidos, suggests creating a bridge to Conscientia through her, he will be the human part and Vanargand can supply the effigy+digital part
	- They agree and get to work, years later, they're ready to flip the switch
		- First time goes directly to Book of Eidos
		- When all necessary events are completed, it proceeds to Ataraxia

Ataraxia
	- Did we fail? Why am I still alive? What's the point of it all?
		- Refugees from the Great Awakening wander the ruins of the Empyrean; Viraocha vows to re-establish society
	- Fight w/ Wulfias and die
		- This takes us to the Red Tower where Eidos gives birth to one of the myriad universes and transcends Conscientia (it created her as they created him, to transcend its own limitations and to see further than its limitations allow)
