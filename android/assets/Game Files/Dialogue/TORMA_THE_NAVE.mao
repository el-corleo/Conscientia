		*An impenetrable darkness cloaks the chamber, though the lengthy echoes from Ormenos' footfalls hint at its impressive dimensions. The room's sole apparent source of illumination hangs high above a broken circle of onyx humanoid statues, some twenty paces ahead. The circle opens toward Ormenos, revealing a silver throne - currently occupied. Closer inspection reveals a second, lesser source of light: behind the throne an imposing blast furnace breathes fire and spits sparks.*

		*Ormenos approaches the carpeted aperture to the circle of statues, noticing that a man of undeniable youth sits upon the silver throne. Reaching the perimeter of the circle he stops and kneels, as instructed.*

The room's sole apparent source of illumination hangs high above a broken circle of onyx humanoid statues, some twenty paces ahead. The circle opens toward Ormenos, revealing a silver throne - currently occupied by the young Thought-Weaver from the Stone Circle, Brother Babel. Closer inspection reveals a second, lesser source of light: behind the throne an imposing blast furnace breathes fire and spits sparks.*

		*In the grips of ecstasy, Ormenos cackles and its warped echo laughs back at him. The power, the absolute dominance he exhibited over the Prime Archon of the Enclave fills him with destructive delight. It is this strength he needs to protect himself from the horrors that await him in the darkness of imbalance; it is this power that will guard against those evil overlords who seek to rob him of agency...*

		*Ormenos feels a tug on his Trueflesh, a cosmic hand peeling a stubborn scab from a half-healed wound. His overwhelming sense of power diminishes as his psyche frays from the strain. Soon it is too great to bear and the skin of his Falseflesh begins to rip apart. All Ormenos can do is laugh at the ruby fountains streaming from his flesh. He laughs a journey from amusement to terror and then on to resentment, stopping finally at resignation; soon the laughs turn to whimpers, and last to silence. The agony so severe, so complete, forces sleep upon the broken mage...*

		*Having reached an agreement, Babel summons Ormenos into the inner circle of statues. He points to the copper disk beneath the throne. Ormenos walks upon it. The Prime Archon then calls to mind the Glyph of Nearcasting. The throne as well as the platform upon which it stands begins to glow until both magi dissolve into nothing but pure light...*

		*Ormenos' Falseflesh reforms upon a copper platform. He now sits in a throne, greeted by the myriad unmoving eyes of onyx statues. These form a ring around him, some twenty paces wide, and mark the edge of all illumination. The shadows beyond seem to pulse, waiting for the light to weaken, waiting to consume everything with unadulterated absence...*

		*He jumps from the throne and rushes out of the circle, into the darkness, stumbling upon the invisible, uneven stones that tile the floor. He knows not what this place could be, but intuits it is the Archon's Apse. His inexplicable knowledge of this is almost as disconcerting as the existence of the forbidden chamber itself.*

		*Ormenos approaches the massive wooden doors leading to the Nave. They stand like two lone trees clinging to an otherwise barren cliffside. Out of place to be sure, but somehow majestic because of their oddity. Etched deep into their collective surface is one lonely symbol - alone because it is all that needs be there - the very symbol of the Enclave. Four alpha omega chimeras stare inward toward a single point, never quite touching at it; four corners suggest a broken square containing them. Shivers sneak their way down his spine - the unwelcome prelude to speaking before the Choir.*

        *The doors begin to fade, breaking the silence not with their own noise but with the din that comes from beyond them, from within the Nave itself. Ormenos enters, walking into a hall much longer than it is wide. Countless unseeing eyes stare down from vaulted ceilings and out from painted walls; here extravagant gilded depictions of familiar Vanquished mythology adorn the six directions. Infamously anything but reserved when it came to their artwork, the Vanquished left behind countless frescoes and mosaics never quite equaled by the bumbling hands that would imitate them after the Great Awakening.*

		*Lining the halls are dozens of red and black marble pillars, so highly polished they conjure up the myriad ghostly reflections of surrounding objects. Between the supports, ornate wooden pews sit in neatly ordered rows with scores of Enclaveans seated upon them. Some come to present their findings on matters of lesser import; others, merely to listen to such reports. For some it is more important to discover; yet for the rest, it is only necessary to remember.*

		*Beyond the benches, a curtained balcony stares down from on high - the mysterious, veiled face of the Choir itself. Beneath it, a narrowing set of stairs lead a half-story below toward an unremarkable wooden door, scarcely tall enough for human use. The door is a focal point for novice gossip and speculation; none know where it leads for certain. But this wonder soon fades as the enigma becomes familiar, and ignorance becomes accepted as a matter of course. Sometimes Ormenos wonders if he is the only Senior member who has not forgotten this hole in their collective knowledge.*

		*Ormenos steps down from the dais to join the throng, just enough to be forgotten. The Jinn Slayer is quick to replace him, ignoring the protests of the magi in line to speak. Once upon the platform, his back to the crowd, he raises a hand fingers outstretched. The loud, angry grunts and speculative muttering persists. One finger curls inward. The noise fades to a dull roar. A second finger curls, seeming to drain the very sound from the air. Before the third finger fully curls, a graveyard silence haunts the Nave. The Enforcer caste has been a gathering storm making lots of waves in the last few months, all centered around this man, and none wish to be out at sea when the storm strikes.*

Out of place to be sure, but somehow majestic because of their oddity. Etched deep into their collective surface is one lonely symbol - alone because it is all that needs be there - the very symbol of the Enclave.

Countless unseeing eyes stare down from vaulted ceilings and out from painted walls; here extravagant gilded depictions of familiar Vanquished mythology adorn the six directions. Infamously anything but reserved when it came to their artwork, the Vanquished left behind countless frescoes and mosaics never quite equaled by the bumbling hands that would imitate them after the Great Awakening.*

The door is a focal point for novice gossip and speculation; none know where it leads for certain. But this wonder soon fades as the enigma becomes familiar, and ignorance becomes accepted as a matter of course. Sometimes Ormenos wonders if he is the only Senior member who has not forgotten this hole in their collective knowledge.*
