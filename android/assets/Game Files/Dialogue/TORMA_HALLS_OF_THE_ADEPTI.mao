		*Two massive hearths evenly roast cheerful groups of magi, basting them in thick swaths of sweat. A far cry from the chilled austerity of the halls or the Mathetia, laughter and jocularity seem to permeate the room, emanating from the myriad groups like steam from a duck on the spit. If ever there were a serious conversation had here, it would be as out of place as Biracul in a brothel.*

		*Frigid bones quickly thawing, Ormenos looks around for a place to rest. Though Ormenos looks only half-heartedly, as nary a chair would be empty at this time of day. Months' worth of fatigue hits his weary Falseflesh all at once, buckling his knees. A hand reaches for the door frame to stabilize the crumbling mage. Resigned laughter weakly leaves his lips no louder than dying whispers. Unintentionally he loses the reins to his Falseflesh and unintentionally he regains them. Nothing is within his control.*

		*Ever since being assigned to the Wayfarer, the Inquisitor has been a man obsessed, intent on being the one to succeed where so many other Thought-Weavers had failed. Yet despite his recent success, he has come to understand just how little his intent matters. Anxiety's shadow hangs over him, as it always has, completely blocking out the light of Awareness. Unknown terrors lurk within the perpetual night, waiting to claim Ormenos' little remaining sanity.*

		*But just as he is about to leave, a mage gets up at the far end of the room, freeing up a space. Opposite the man is the Inquisitor's young apprentice and fellow Jeran, Brother Mind Seer, feverishly penning his latest musings in the notebook he always seems to have at his side. This obsessiveness with details has always hindered the Mind Seer's ability to spot the tiger for wont of fixating on its stripes.*

		*Determination seeps into the hesitant lines creasing the Mind Seer's brow. He rises, politely bows his head in deference to his mentor, and makes for the underhalls. As the only two Jerans in the Order, Ormenos has always felt a bond with the Mind Seer otherwise absent in his interactions with the Brothers and Sisters of the Enclave. Like caring for a real brother - or, given their age dissimilarity, a son, perhaps.*

		*As he turns to leave, hints of whispers reach his ears, the serious tone a stark contrast to the levity that surrounds it. He listens closely, but not too intently, lest he meet the mantis' fate in its pursuit of prey. Indeed, he recalls the Phrygian admonitions on being too absorbed in a task. Proof positive is that all magi here congregated were utterly unaware of this errant group due to a devout pursuit of frivolity. No, Ormenos did not want to hunt only to then become the hunted. But if he is careful, perhaps he can pluck the prize without first tripping the wire...*

		*Warmth banishes the chill hiding in Ormenos' bones. So subtly did the wintry halls rob him of heat that he barely even noticed. Only now in the presence of warmth does he realize just how little heat remained within him. The Inquisitor had often thought this of Time, but only now does he connect the two events, wondering what other resource of his now slowly - nay, imperceptibly - diminishes beyond his awareness...*

		*Embers fade to ash, the dying breaths of the Calefactory's two great fires. The moon has risen and all magi should be in their quarters. Should be. Yet, crystalline lanterns carve light from the shadows, revealing a sizable crowd, all of the Enforcer caste given their cloaks. Where there should be none, dozens congregate. This breach of protocol is just another mystery tickling the Inquisitor's greatest weakness: his curiosity.*

Some answers he likely knows, others are genuine mysteries, ripe for the unraveling.*

		*He wipes the thin stream of drool escaping his lips and searches the room for an empty seat - easier to find a specific memory among the Wayfarer's chaotic sea of thoughts. As his eyes scan the room, he notices a Brother resting just outside the kitchen. One of the few magi specializing in something other than Techne - more of an honorary mage, perhaps - this is the man whose back story defies all logic, the man name Cook Ding. He is unique among their Order, for his mind is unlike the others: truly invisible to mindsight. Ones such as him are not found anywhere outside of Kabu - Unseen, they call it there. This added to the fact that his tales strain credulity in an already insane world and the result is a very fragmented picture of his past. A genuine mystery, that one.*

		*With a smile and a nod, Cook Ding happily returns to his work. Spotting the newly vacated seat, Ormenos moves to occupy it. An uncontrollable urge to gorge wells up within him as he loads his plate with fine cuts of meat, steamed vegetables and anything he can get his hands on, dousing it all in dozens of sauces.*

        *Ormenos feeds along with all his other nameless, pig brethren. They are all lost in this decadent moment of carnal indulgence. Hand to food, and food to mouth, they perform their rhythmic dance. Juices stream down their jowls as they shovel and chew, shovel and chew. Diminutive Cloudstones busily deliver more dishes and wines for them to quench their voracious appetites.*

		*Bellies fill faster than desire can diminish; stomachs stretch beyond comfort; and a choral flatulence indicates many among them have more than surpassed their natural limits. But even desire soon dissipates when faced with this much excess. It mutates, now spiced with shame and regret, balanced by the knowledge they have all transgressed together - a crime in company is far more palatable than a solitary affair.*

        *Ormenos rises from his seat, ready to depart. He stumbles away from the table, half-comatose, wondering why those of the Order only abandon the path of Discipline when in the Refectory - especially when it is elsewhere enforced with utmost severity. The Phrygian wisemen once said that a string wound too tightly is prone to snapping. An adequate explanation? At any rate, he no longer cares, for the blood from his brain now quietly transfers to his gut in order to better cope with the mess he has created down there...*

        Yet, all a hungry mage can do now is sate himself with the memories of delights once tasted; for the feasts are over as night descends upon the Enclave.*
