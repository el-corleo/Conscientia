ARCHIVES
>>>Checks where you came from, i.e., did you come directly or go exploring<<<
	[/KAVU!CISTERN!ARCHIVES!10.X000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*HERE there are copies of several important texts from the Tacrivian Archives in case something should happen, Biracul forbid. The Overseer asks if he will finally have some peace and quiet now this infernal Cage has been repaired.

        ALSO, there's a huge repository that becomes locked off once Rikos defeats Gurgadon. Can go there to read some copied tomes before fight.

        RIKOS cannot make the cage move unless he has the Sigil of Wulfias from the Chamber of Bones.*

BRIDGE

		*THE body is heavy, but his burden is now Rikos' burden: the burden of leadership. This load is light by comparison. Hear sounds of water coursing through the tubes.
		
		MOVE into the Chamber of Bones, where only Dazilan magi are allowed.*

______________
CHAMBER OF BONES
	[/KAVU!CISTERN!CHAMBER OF BONES!10.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*THIS is Rikos' first time in the Chamber. He finds a place to put his father and then sees a curious item, a Sigil. Wulfias' Sigil. It says below it that it the true sign of a Dazilan mage, with it, the Wellspring's secrets are his. He had heard of it before from his father, though he had also heard that no mage in history had ever figured out what it was for since there were no Silver Thrones to be found. The Sigil was found there and never removed from its place - yet for some reason Rikos moves it.

        THERE is also a passageway he can walk through to the Chantry of the Martyr, Refectory of the Valvorthr, and Hall of Atonement (with different names, obviously). They contain forgotten tomes and maybe something else.
		
		CAN go check out the Cage now, or go down through the Chantry, Refectory, Hall path (TODO)*

FARCASTER CHAMBER

		*RIKOS sees the Farcaster and recognizes the seal. He suggests that when they get back, they should have people study its markings to see whether it's like the ones in Tambul and Dazil.
        
        PROCEED to Ravine.*

	[/KAVU!CISTERN!GATE OF THE HEATHEN!10.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*EXPLORE the familiar stomping grounds before performing funeral rites or perform them directly.
		
		IF explore, then a guardian of the Chamber of Bones mentions the Tambulan bodywasher has finished dressing Drakos' corpse and they are about to deposit it in the Chamber of Bones.*

SANCTUM OF GURGADON
	[/KAVU!CISTERN!SANCTUM OF GURGADON!10.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*GURGADON fight: Ark and Rik fight hard. Rik slays it with LUIN. He's bleeding heavily, passes out and wakes up at his Manor.
		
		AS Rik passes out, he sees a vision of someone trying to possess him, to take command of his body. He literally asks, "Who are you? What... are you...?" before he passes out.*

SILVER THRONE
	[/KAVU!CISTERN!SILVER THRONE!10.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*WULFIAS' skeleton occupies the throne. LUIN's crystal pulsing in his hand. Rik gets LUIN.

        THE Sigil resonates, begging Rik to use it. Rik talks to FATHOM and then opens the path to Gurgadon, who rushes out, cracking the tiles beneath and ripping open the ceiling. His tail whips Rik into the Sanctum and Ark follows as the beast retreats back into its lair.*

		*WITNESS the Clockwork Crow statues and two bowls of sacrifice. Someone is changing out the bowls.
		
		WITNESS the Drakos' body being prepared. Then say the words, "May you watch over the Wellspring with the Choir of Magi as they have since the beginning, as they have since the Heathen saw Biracul's light and made this spring flow."
		
		CARRY the body into the Chamber of Bones via the Bridge to witness the burial.*
