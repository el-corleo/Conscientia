Even a small water cistern sits nearby, though it is now as empty as the facilities it services. At present, it seems the sole occupants of Arkâ€™s Beacon are solitude and fading memories.
		
		Bringing her attention to the wall whose shadow now envelops her, she notices that on either side, a stairway leads to the top of the fortress walls.
		
		Suddenly, laughter shatters the solemn silence of the Wastes, reminding Eidos she is not actually alone. She turns to find Heyar some twenty paces off, laughing at one of his own inane jokes - probably the same one.*

Torn asunder by the hands of gods, these perfectly opposing siblings now spend eternity in each other's antagonistic company.*

		*Evidence of an ancient riverbed pours forth from the canyon as well, with water-rounded stones strewn about leading to a southern precipice. The sheer drop here is of an impressive magnitude and the long-dead waterfall that once fell from this ledge appears to have cut a path straight down to the bottom of the butte Kabu rests upon. Peering over the edge, Eidos spots a bridge halfway down uniting an incline coming out of the eastern crater with the western Wastes. Down the slope towards the east are some flatlands, bleached whiter than bones.*

While the dust settles around her within the toothless grin of the canyon, Eidos looks out upon the landscape of utter desolation with which the Wasteland greets her. Out of the pan and into the fire, it seems.
		
		Through the haze of blowing dust, Eidos can distinguish a solitary destination on the horizon: jagged, obsidian ridges, jutting from the sand like a crown of dark swords upon the parched skull of the Waste.*

Ur'Ruk now far behind her, she stops to survey her surroundings, and her unfazed army obediently awaits its master's orders. The deathly white draugnir legions stand in stark contrast to the Neverborn, as they chaotically pace like an excited gas cloud while ravenously drooling inky fluid; the Neverborn, on the other hand, rigidly stand in tight, orderly formations, as motionless as statues, as if frozen in time.*

		*Moving across the void surface of the crater, Eidos proceeds robbed of sight. Though she feels silt and rock beneath her feet, she sees absolutely nothing. Every time she reluctantly lowers her eyes to the light-thieving madness of the ground, her feet hesitate before tripping into her next steps, making progress nearly impossible. Thus, with her eyes skyward, she cautiously proceeds, her feet as her sole sensors.*

Eidos begins to question whether this moment already happened or has yet to come, whether her last step preceded or postdated the current one. It is almost as through she is straddling the dimensions of space without changing her location relative to the axis of time, save a bump forward or a step back. And yet somehow this state of timelessness, of frozen moments, does not seem foreign to her. She accepts it, embraces it and walks as though this were her natural state. But try as she may, she finds it impossible to orient herself with respect to the axis of time.*

		Far off in the distance, the dying afternoon sun reflects off a leviathanic bridge as it slithers the span of the canyon in an uninterrupted arcing motion. Thousands of interlocking plates, shiny as polished mirrors, coat the bridge like some kind of enormous metallic serpent. Perhaps most stunning, however, is that the structure miraculously lacks any and all supports. It simply rests there as though suspended from the sky itself.
		
		While the canyon's western side hosts the brilliant splendor of a shining silvered spire, the eastern termination is host only to the ruined stump of its kin. The remains of the golden sister tower have long since toppled to the canyon floor, far below the bestial bridge.*

		Far off in the distance, the dying afternoon sun reflects off a leviathanic bridge as it slithers the span of the canyon in an uninterrupted arcing motion. Thousands of interlocking plates, shiny as polished mirrors, coat the bridge like some kind of enormous metallic serpent. Perhaps most stunning, however, is that the structure miraculously lacks any and all supports. It simply rests there as though suspended from the sky itself.

The sun, unobstructed now, cooks the ground beneath her and she finds her leg bindings make for poor armor against these burning sands. In time, her torturous steps lead her to a view of a distant mountain range. The summits of the peaks lay low, a mere handspan above the flats they tower over, dying off rather suddenly as they melt into the flats.*

Between Kabu and the mountain range, there is no reprieve from the ravages of this wasted land. If anything, these flats reject life with an even greater ferocity than the Kaban wastes high above.
		
		The earth's skin cracks and peels all about. The sun bakes what little moisture remains from the air, warping everything in sight. No animals, no plants, not even the carcasses thereof decorate this place. Even death itself seems to avoid these flats.*

Though, a deprivation of illumination so thorough pervades the passage that light from the exterior is immediately rejected at the aperture. Reflected upon this pitch barrier are only leaden-hued insecurities. All the phantoms of fear spawning in a simultaneous assault on the psyche.*

Or as though the reflections were external, symptomatic of a troubled outside world. Truly a mirror of the self and not of the form. Or perhaps she fears nothing simply because she feels the choice is never hers to make, as if constantly nudged to and fro by a hand unseen. What will be, will be; and all, then, is as it should always be. Could it ever be otherwise?*

The sun, unobstructed now, cooks the ground beneath her and she finds her leg bindings make for poor armor against these burning sands. In time, her torturous steps lead her to a view of a distant mountain range. The summits of the peaks lay low, a mere handspan above the flats they tower over, dying off rather suddenly as they melt into the flats.*

Or perhaps she fears nothing simply because she feels the choice is never hers to make, as if constantly nudged to and fro by a hand unseen.

Eidos squints, trying to regulate the flow of her visual floodgates as she grows accustomed to her reawakening consciousness. She feels the rhythmic dance of her digits, her limbs, and finally her body as blood pulsates through them. Aching muscles contract uneasily, fibers sliding against each other like rusted iron rods. But eventually she manages to pry herself from the ground, kneeling on the desert sand.*

		*Eidos trudges across the cracked earth of the Wastes, white dust blowing all about. Slowly, the shining pool of darkness she aims for draws closer, though her increasing proximity does little to reveal its true nature. Indeed, it is not until she is nearly upon the site that she can see it for the stone it is, rather than the tenebrous liquid it purported to be.*

		*Looking down into the abyssal black of the ancient ruin, Eidos observes an infinity of concentric angles, each reflecting what little light finds its way downward. This entire formation appears to have acted as a foundation for some superstructure in times immemorial, and further inspection unveils a stairwell carved out of the shiny rock leading down into its depths.*

		*Turning towards a cracked column, Eidos looks upon a pair of burning yellow eyes. The beast is a wolf, though the darkness of its fur nearly renders the predator invisible to her eye. A guttural growl escapes its throat and its lips peel back in a snarl, revealing pearly fangs studded in ruby droplets. The menacing noise rumbles like distant thunder, vibrating blood and drool as they stream down into its matted fur.*

The youth is draped in a tattered, white garment, its green glow tempered by dull splatters of blood, as though it had been drenched in a baptism of violence. Yet for all the gore, an angelic smile remains fixed upon its delicate face, a smile belying utter joy. Eidos looks upon the face of the child and knows in her mind's eye that it innocently longs to bathe in her blood as well.*

		*Turning towards a cracked column, Eidos looks upon a massive creature cut from cobalt, crushing the melted glass beneath its weight. While baffled by how she could have failed to notice such a behemoth before now, it nevertheless could explain how this place met its ruin. The beast drips incandescent vapor upon the stair near Eidos' feet, cracking the glass further with unbearable heat. Brilliant spikes along the creatures back ignite in a glorious rage and soon, Eidos can feel the light of a thousand suns welling up within its carapace, gleaming white-hot.*

		*Turning towards a cracked column, Eidos looks upon a twisted man. While he is aged and in no part fair, this wrinkled face is decayed and rotten away on one side. More terrible than his appearance is the certainty that he has appeared of his own choosing. Much of his form remains cloaked from view, and Eidos can feel the caustic effects of his corrupted soul dissolving her own. She feels terror or the Sylvan Architect, the burning desire to return to the Red Tower, a need to survive... And she knows that if she continues to stand in the presence of this abomination she will be rendered to nothing but a pile of whimpering, quivering flesh.*

Indescribable and imperceptible in any traditional sense, like a frigid wind it is known only by its chilling effects. Eidos feels herself being rendered down into nothing, all Self simply melting away. Her Glyphs robbed from her mind and her very name annihilated in darkness. Yet, even still, this Thing, is but a shadow, a mere impression of something beyond It. Eidos can feel her mind being directed towards a Door Unseen. A Portal of Unending Night that will be her unmaking...*

No longer dead and dry, it runs in a raging torrent of viscous quicksilver, toxic vapors boiling up from beyond. The leviathanic nightmare slowly draws its coils tighter, cracking the foundations all around.*

		*Eidos descends with unwanted swiftness, the grit of granulated crystal causing her to slide uncontrollably, straight down the steep incline. A rather abrupt metamorphosis transforms the steep incline into a sheer drop, casting Eidos into a pile of loose salt below. The resulting impact sends a dull thud echoing through the rising white pillars all around her. The echoes reflect and collide, eventually enveloping Eidos in their mocking laughter.
		
		The sound of the crash lingers in the air, but soon races away from her, and this decrescendo highlights her labored breaths. Rising from the pile, the grating sound of salt on salt again fills the environs with weak but sharp reverberations. She steps into the forest, every step, every action answered back by magnified distortions echoing off the massive pillars around her.*

It looks as if a patch of midnight were lying suspended before her in defiance of the pitiless face of the sun. Beyond the ridge of the crater, due south, she sees a collection of distant, broken towers. A short drop - twice her height or so - off the southern ledge where she currently stands leads to the crater towards the ruined city.*

		*The terrain evens out into a flat plateau. Yet, while Eidos is now spared the exertion of steep ascents, the unrelenting wind is likewise free of impediment. Soon, a deadly mixture of fine particles and razor-sharp sand is conjured up from the ground, spiraling all about her. Eidos is forced to shield her unprotected eyes against the stinging cyclones of glassy assailants.
		
		Up ahead, through the whirling veil of dust and sand, she can make out a forest of white pillars, salty giants rising up from the desert wastes with a regularity belying their artificial nature. And yet the forest is vast, utterly beyond the reach of man.*

What little she can see, however, only hints at the enormous stature of the beast.*

The displaced chunk appears to have collapsed down onto a lower shelf, a place she could certainly descend to, but would equally certainly be unable to return from.
		
		Beneath her feet, the ground is formed from writhing, snaking patterns of what looks to be impacted salt, melted together under immense heat or pressure. Jutting up from this surface are jagged spikes of ever-increasing height, composed of the same white crystalline material that seems to cover the pillars. These spikes lead from the creature's open mouth out into the east and merge with the salt pillars below.*

Now approaching to scrutinize it, Eidos sees that the metallic blue sheen extends the length of its carapace. She likewise discovers two holes in the head, revealing what were once the void eyes of the creature. The calcified layer atop the metallic husk seems to have been a trait acquired postmortem and cracks away at random intervals, flaking off and rejoining its dusty brethren upon the desert floor.

However, their composition is unrecognizable, so encrusted and mineralized are they by the raging shardstorm that sweeps across the Wasteland.

Soon, a deadly mixture of fine particles and razor shards is conjured up from the ground, spiraling all about them. They are forced to shield their unprotected eyes against the stinging cyclones of glassy assailants, though the insane scholar laughs the whole time.
		
		Up ahead, through the whirling veil of dust and sand, Eidos can make out a forest of white pillars, salty giants rising up from the desert wastes with a regularity belying their artificial nature. And yet the forest is vast, utterly beyond the reach of man.*

Walking around it some twenty paces, Eidos sees only part of its head and spine clawing through a sandy outer crust, like the fleeing bones of a man unaware of his own death. What little she can see, however, only hints at the enormous stature of the beast.*

The displaced chunk appears to have collapsed down onto a lower shelf, a place she could certainly descend to, but would equally certainly be unable to return from.
		
		Beneath her feet, the ground is formed from writhing, snaking patterns of what looks to be impacted salt, melted together under immense heat or pressure. Jutting up from this surface are jagged spikes of ever-increasing height, composed of the same white crystalline material that seems to cover the pillars. These spikes lead from the creature's open mouth out into the east and merge with the salt pillars below.
		
		And of course, the eccentric Heyar appears to be milling about as though he were looking for his next 'great' find.*
