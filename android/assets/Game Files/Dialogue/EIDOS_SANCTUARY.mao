		*Feet guide her to the rising stairs. This stairwell is large, but not so large as the one below. Further differences arise in the square shape and lack of railing. But a kindred trait does it find in that here, too, all light is natural light seeping in through an opening at its zenith.
		
		She begins her climb. Step summing upon step, an apparently unending ascension skywards up the shaft of a large square tower tries Eidos' patience, stretching it to a hair's breadth. That she makes her way up is clear; that there is any reward in this climb remains a mystery.
		
		But as she presses on, the passage seems to get ever warmer, and in time, she reaches the top - evidenced by the now-visible portal inviting her to exit the indifferent infinity of stairs.*

		*Off to her right, light filters into the room through a closed portcullis, obstructing passage through to the bridge beyond. At the far end of the room is a rather ominous set of stairs, winding itself upwards into darkness. The only remaining pathway exiting this chamber is the one deeper into the bowels of the edifice.
		
		Suspiciously conspicuous is the writing crudely scratched into the floor here - large, bold letters, with shapes somewhat discernible even from this distance.*

		*The portcullis, large and of metallic construction as it is, promises to resist motion with all the might of gravity - its indefatigable ally. Peering through its checkered apertures, Eidos' eyes overcome the barrier that would thwart her Falseflesh's progress. Beyond it is a lengthy bridge, scaled like a shimmering serpent, slithering across the chasm it overlooks.
		
		The serpentine bridge seems to terminate at a similar gateway, at the opposite end of the chasm, though no portcullis obstructs passage there. To the left of the portcullis seems to be an apparatus or mechanism by which it is lifted through some trick of magic or artifice - likely related to the inert crystal it houses.*

		*Instinct becomes will, will then becoming thought. An image slowly forms, burning out lines from the void. A circle manifests, weaving an intricate tapestry of lines, never crossing, as they traverse dimensions linking paths among them. And soon, the Glyph of Resurrection is fully formed, completing the reaction. Energy cascades into the crystal, Eidos as its source. She feels her life gradually slipping away, but ever so slightly, as the crystal is sated well before any harm may come to her.
		
		Replete with its newfound sustenance, the crystal blinds with its sharp, violet radiance. The energy within shocks the mechanism into motion. The portcullis counters gravity's antagonistic effects, levitating itself upwards into a recessed position in the gateway, leaving the way to the bridge unobstructed.*

Just then, a number of expressionless Tacribian warriors spring forth from the caverns on the opposite side of the bridge. For the briefest of eternities, time stands still.*

		Eidos executes the Techne of Extraction, ingesting the energy contained within the crystal. In an instant, the portcullis loosens and comes crashing to the ground, once more barring the Dazirans' malefactors from entrance.*

But then, someone notices Eidos' presence: an understandably shocked and confused Logira. Channeling all of her attention on the figure standing across the room from her, Logira attempts to cut through the dusty air with her vision. Confusion then turns to revulsion as she confirms Eidos' identity. And choking down a bitter rage, she speaks.*

		*With the portcullis closed, the passage to the Dawn Fortress is completely obstructed. The thwarted Tacribians have left two warriors outside the gate to secure the premises should Eidos foolishly re-open it. With the piercing eyes of a pair of desert hawks, they carefully observe her every move.
		
		However, Eidos, as though under the influence of some spell, cannot resist the desire to fulfill Logira's wish - or at the very least refuses to oppose it. She is pulled towards the exit of the Antechamber; for the Wellspring calls to her. Yet she cannot help but muse on what other wonders may remain undiscovered in the lower levels. However, promises hold great sway; words once uttered cannot be retrieved... The incantation of oath once more begins to compel Eidos toward the completion of Logira's will.*

		*Her footfalls echo off into the immense darkness, as though fleeing from some unseen evil. Cracked tiles complain with every step. Deep into the hall, stands a massive tree, its tremendous trunk bursting forth from the floor in defiance of the rigid granite. Though it was no doubt mighty in its prime, splintering bark and leafless branches betray its current frailty. Charred gashes in its roots weakly pulsate with a dying, greenish luminescence while exposing the tree's ancient innards.
		
		Incredibly, this tree is clearly visible despite the hall's pervading darkness. Dimly it glows, as if caught in the fading rays of twilight. The absence of an obvious source of light suggests that the tree is made visible through some inner power - one as frail and decayed as the withered giant itself.
		
		Although much of the room's illumination seems to come from the interaction between the tree and her vision, Eidos also senses a faint, green glow oozing in from the depths of the underground Archive - its source yet invisible to her.*

		*Though the tree appears to dominate much of the space, the enormous size of the hall containing it slowly becomes apparent. The vaulted ceiling is unfathomably high, consumed by shadows at its peak. Between each support column, rows of aged, wooden shelves line the hall; they in turn are lined with the cracked and brittle remains of countless tomes. Arranged in concentric circles, rippling outward from the tree, are many long tables, benches and writing desks - no doubt placed here for the reading and copying of texts.*

        *Walking forward, Eidos notes that the majority of the tomes and shelves share the same dusty blanket as the stairs that lead here. Yet evidence that the area has seen more recent use abounds. Certain tables have stacks of books piled upon them and a number of volumes lie open as if abandoned in mid-read.*

The unbridled limbs of the forgotten tree have crept their way across the ceiling only to then slither downwards around the doorway, wreathing its perimeter.*

The one to the left is slumped against a wall, smeared with blood, while the other is lying face down in front of the archway. Next to the bodies is a curious platform, raised perhaps a handspan above the ground and emanating a faint violet haze.*

Finally, there are the two corpses that lie in deathly companionship to the lifeless tree.*

		*Eidos first examines the body stretched out before the archway. Fingers reaching to touch it, she discovers that the skin more closely resembles a supple, metallic husk than a leather hide. Whatever these things were, they were decidedly not human. 

        Tracing the fallen creature's form with her fingertips, she comes upon a trail of dark, blue fluid. Her eyes follow the curious substance as it leads to the gash that likely ended it. Too neat, too precise, too lonely, nothing about it suggests a struggle. The body is also lightly coated with dust - not as much as the steps leading here, but enough to hint at a lengthy passage of time. Remarkably, though, no visible decay has marred the pale skin.*

		*Turning her attention to the body slumped against the left wall, Eidos notices a rather unique feature: the absence of a head. Yet the dissimilarities stop there, for it too is free from decay and likewise possesses a metallic hide. Furthermore, what appeared to be blood smeared upon the wall behind it is, in truth, more of the oily bluish fluid found covering the first body.*

		*She steps closer to the streaks of blue on the wall. Oddly, they remain aqueous in nature, simply refusing to dry or even drip to the floor below. Bringing her nose closer, a few quick inhalations reveal no discernible smell. This close to the wall, she finally sees it. Not the blood, not the impenetrable barrier, but rather the wall itself - or rather what it was.*

		*Beneath the blood of the creature, is part of an image. Wiping the blood and dust aside, she sees the faded traces of a fresco. Though aged and worn in places, it looks to be a stylized representation of the tree looming over her. Flecks of metallic reflections give the impression that it may once have been illuminated in silver, though it is hard to say for certain.
		
		Images of people seem to have also been traced, and though their relationship with the wooden giant is unclear, at least one individual seems to be walking from the tree bearing some kind of seedling - where to is impossible to determine.*

		*Curiously, a single human shape adorns the base of the tree, seemingly entangled in its roots. A curvy, feminine form seems to be the tree's macabre source of sustenance. Scanning up towards the branches, it looks as though there are more figures nestled within, though these have been almost entirely eroded away by time.
		
		Miraculously, one image remains intact, untouched by entropy's avarice. It is a circle, or halo, crowning the top of the tree. Within this curved shape are a great number of overlapping lines etched into the stone. Whatever this symbol is, Eidos does not recognize it.*

Scanning up towards the branches, it looks as though there are more figures nestled within, though these have been almost entirely eroded away by time.
		
		Miraculously, one image remains intact, untouched by entropy's avarice. It is a circle, or halo, crowning the top of the tree. Within this curved shape are a great number of overlapping lines etched into the stone. A Glyph, one whose meaning now seems innately known. A Glyph, one which resonates with the Sigil she received: the Sigil of Awareness.*

		Eidos' eyes are drawn upward as they follow the massive trunk. Its branches stretch out to the vaulted ceiling and beyond as their growth was of sufficient force to crack through the stonework above in places. However, this must have happened ages before the current furnishings, as no fallen rubble litters the floor.*

Speaking with a wordless voice, Eidos is drawn into communion with the mind of the tree. The tree's whispers take her through time, guided by its soothing and affectionate voice. As if picking up a conversation with an old friend, new memories begin to blossom within her mind. The tree weaves tales of ancient travelers, myths of proto-societies and many other stories, passionately told and devoutly remembered.*

A circle manifests, weaving an intricate tapestry of lines, never crossing, as they traverse dimensions linking paths among them. And soon, the Glyph is fully formed, completing the reaction.
		
		With a mere spark of desire, she has called the Glyph of Resurrection to mind, offering the fruit of her body as nourishment to the slumbering tree. The Glyph then serves to link the two beings and the energy begins to flow steadily from Eidos into the Muninn. The tree's roots drink deeply of Eidos' essence, and she begins to feel its life wax as her own wanes. The sap begins to course anew through the Muninn's ancient pores, and her blood begins to slow. As life is breathed into the withered boughs, her lungs gasp for air. As the ancient Muninn Tree regains its awareness, she feels her own winking out...*

		When she tires of this, Eidos lifts one of her hands to peek, where an irritated and slighted solitude greets her gaze.

		As soon as this knowledge dawns within her, the mural's impression on her changes. Her mind's eye witnesses the hooded figures turning their heads toward her, looking upon Eidos with expectation. Suddenly, the door and mural fade from view, revealing before her a chamber shrouded in a smoky veil of deep blue light.*

Burning brightly at the center, the Glyph of Eidos activates. Soon the portal's physicality wanes like a half-forgotten memory.

		*This short and narrow hallway is lined with the graven images of men and women at arms. They are finely carved, with no trace nor marks of the tools that wrought them. Yet, their forms are rough and simplistic, primarily comprised of simple angles and straight lines.
		
		The ceiling hangs low enough to touch with a short leap, and the corridor's width scarcely exceeds her armspan. A dim light seeps in from the opening at the far end where the hall pours into a vast chamber, though something thwarts the light from completely consuming the doorway.*

		*Eidos walks toward the doorway. As she draws nearer to the opening, the source of the blockage becomes apparent. What once appeared to be simply a void carved from light gains detail. Its weaker shadows emphasize its smooth contours and rugged features. Immobile before her stands a tall, statuesque figure, a spear held at its side. Its expression is cold, and its demeanor dispassionate. As if carved from stone, its features are flawless but for the large gashes rent into its face and abdomen - surely not the signs of an easy occupation. Glistening, blue liquid slowly leaks from its wounds, serving as a natural highlight of the sentry's figure.
		
		In an alcove, nearly consumed in shadows, a Glyph appears to call to her; it offers an escape.*

The sentry has not yet reacted, and Eidos remains undetected. It stands motionless with its spear at its side, as if to deny Eidos' very existence.*

		*Instinct becomes will, will then becoming thought. An image slowly forms, burning out lines from the void. A circle manifests, weaving an intricate tapestry of lines, never crossing, as they traverse dimensions linking paths among them. And soon, the Glyph is fully formed, completing the reaction.
		
		The Glyph of the Occult lends power to its Hidden Mind Techne casting an invisible veil around Eidos. The brief flash of the Glyph dissipates in her mind's eye and she begins walking as silently as possible towards the doorway - almost skulking like a frightened dog.

		*Walking through the large gateway, Eidos is met with a strange sight. Before her is a descending staircase of concentric steps, fanning out into a large square hall. At first glance, this hall appears to be filled with hundreds of statues, all arranged in perfect rows. However, as Eidos draws nearer, the statues all turn to face her. Heads twist in a half circle following her path down the steps, all staring with expectation.*

		*At the opposite end is a wide corridor, wide enough for several files of statues to pass through at a time. But perhaps most peculiar is that between Eidos and the exit there are two rather ornate sarcophagi - marbled exteriors, with several odd Glyphs engraved upon them.

A comfortable and inviting satin insulation fills the stony casket - though, of course, more outstanding is that there is an emerald elixir within.

		*Shifting her gait toward the corridor, Eidos intends to exit the chamber. She walks alone down the hallway for about a hundred paces before approaching what appears to be a dead end. Soon, the gradual emergence of the Glyph of Awareness begins to brighten the passage, resonating with the Sigil she now bears. The light fades and a portal to the outside begins to appear as the rocky wall condenses into a single point where the Glyph had shone previously.*

		*Seeking the source of ethereal light, Eidos enters a tetrahedral chamber. Three sides angled in on each other make up the walls, tapering severely, high above. Reflective panels arranged on a grid cover all four surfaces like the scales of a silver serpent. The chamber itself is small, the width spanning but five paces outward from the center, though the ceiling might well be five times Eidos' height.
		
		Gaze now set upon the middle of the room, she sees the emerald light pervading the area emanates from a crystal. The shimmering object is suspended midair as though in some invisible, viscous fluid. Beyond it, a familiar dark glass adorns the wall, embedded chest-high at one of the intersections to the myriad reflective tiles.*

		*Eidos approaches the crystal, entranced by its rhythmic pulsations. Tentatively raising a hand, she reaches out to touch it. The pulsations increase with an unbridled frenzy the closer her hand comes. Then, contact. And like a cracked dam giving way, its toxic contents - thoughts of bloodlust, innocence, death, protection - all rush through her head.*

		Calling to mind the Glyph of Fenrir, Eidos places hand to crystal and executes her Extraction Techne. A shock travels down her spine, spreading out like ink on fabric. Then a name - 'Luin' - resounds in Eidos' mind and the eldritch glow soon coalesces into an emerald sword - a vision of her new talent, the reward for her current pain...*

A single thought resonates across her headspace as the shock of her new talent fades away: 'Luin'.*

		*Stepping across the threshold, Eidos finds herself in a room wholly unlike the one she just left. The simple geometry of the previous area looks primitive in comparison to the dizzying array of shapes that now confront her. Lines and curves intersect to form intricate, extra-dimensional patterns that lace all surfaces.
		
		Staring at any given surface gives the impression of standing between two mirrors and looking off into their simulated infinities. But this effect is true from all angles Eidos seems to choose, and perhaps from every possible angle.*

		*Eidos' eyes next fall upon the elliptical table dominating the middle of the room. Unfathomably dark, yet somehow polished to the point of reflection - even from under the thick layers of dust upon it. A number of smooth, lacquered chairs surround the abyssal table, all impeccably aligned with a perfect mirror's symmetry.
		
		Then she sees it - the blue haze's source. A spherical crystal has been placed upon a simple and unpolished jade stand, near the edge of the table. It is as dissimilar to the room as a shadow is to the light that casts it, a warped and distorted echo introduced by foreign elements into a forbidden plane.*

The resonance persists, gently at first but ever gaining in intensity, until finally a vision coalesces at its center. The vision links with Eidos and soon becomes her assumed reality. Through the eyes of another, Eidos remembers - not memories of her own making, yet still distinctly hers somehow.*

A circle manifests, weaving an intricate tapestry of lines, never crossing, as they traverse dimensions linking paths among them. And soon, the Glyph is fully formed, completing the reaction.
		
		Without knowing why, Eidos calls Fenrir's Glyph to mind. And without knowing how, the shining object in her hand dims as it begins to inject its contents into her Trueflesh, light waning until it vanishes completely.
		
		The emptied husk of crystal soon slips from her hand, crashing to the ground and cracking into perfectly equal blue slivers. But Eidos is too preoccupied with the surges of conflicting emotions now present within her mind. They seek to disrupt like unrelenting waves crashing against stubborn cliffs...*

WINDING STAIR

		*Emerging from the tunnel, Eidos steps onto a winding stairway. Finely cut black granite, embellished with marble accents, seems the material of choice. Yet, the dominant feature here is not the stair itself; far more prominent a feature is nothingness. Even a cursory observation reveals the stairway's true nature as but a narrow strip winding around a vast column of empty space.*

		*The air here is dry and stale, unperturbed long enough to stratify by density. The thickest of it clusters at the bottom, eating away all intrusions of light.
		
		A thin layer of dust coating the stairs suggests that Eidos' newly added footsteps are the first to disrupt the balance in quite some time. Though the steps may not have seen any recent use, they are in a state far from disrepair. Brushing away a swath of the dust with her hand, Eidos sees the floors have been carefully polished, showing no cracks, no threat of crumbling. It is as though they were only recently crafted. Rich marble veins of geometric designs carve their way through this landing, though only humble shapes adorn the individual steps leading to and from it.*

Her suspicions feel confirmed as she observes the motes of dust floating alongside her, sparkling from their collisions with the light. They begin to dance around her, this microcosm of false stars, whirling inwards towards her. She reaches a hand out to grab them, but they quickly scurry away, propelled by the wind of her motion.*
