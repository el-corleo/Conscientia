		*It is not long before Eidos is completely robbed of sight. The going through this way is treacherous; for with all rays of golden sun consumed by the shadows, there is no light to guide her way. Many times she stumbles and cuts herself on the jagged crust of the uncertain and winding tunnel.
		
		The echoes of her steps expand and she halts abruptly. She can feel her vision slowly returning. As she tentatively renews her forward march, a cold, cerulean glow comes into view, brighter and more radiant than natural phosphorous could ever be. Soon, she finds the cryptic light's source: a shining, aquamarine glass lies on the cave floor, seemingly discarded.*

		*It is not long before Eidos is completely robbed of sight. The going through this way is treacherous; for with all rays of golden sun consumed by the shadows, there is no light to guide her way. Many times she stumbles and cuts herself on the jagged crust of the uncertain and winding tunnel.
		
		The echoes of her steps expand and she halts abruptly. She can feel her vision slowly returning as her eyes cease resisting the darkness. The amorphous forms now take on the shape of rock, scarred by their vain battles against water and time.
		
		Then, a vision, a memory, the Mindscape. Though Eidos has not been here, she has before seen this place in her dreams. She knows that further ahead, the path widens into a more spacious chamber and that someone there abides.*

		*The sun at her back, Eidos enters into the rocky mouth of the cave. Her eyes observantly attending to her new surroundings, she spies a short passage spread out before her, where light is at war with the shadows. The cave's stony fangs act as the shields for a clearly outmatched darkness. 
		
		In truth, the light only gained greater ground after Eidos had opened the portal leading from the canyon. Yet, this advance is swiftly stifled by the resealing of the entrance. As such, the shadows now seep back in, reconquering their lost ground.*

		*But the passage ends almost as soon as it begins, terminating in a spherical chamber more radiant than the setting sun. A series of variegated crystals direct their focused beams into a single, suspended white sphere at the center of the room. 
		
		Beneath the brilliant globe is a golden platform, much like the one in the Awakening Chamber, yet distinct in its markings. Its saccharine presence entices, like honey for the mind. Its metallic scent permeates the room, seeping into Eidos' pores, as if it seeking to join forms with her.*

		*Eidos ceremoniously proceeds toward the platform, expectations of their eventual union rising in her boiling blood. It appears just as though her ultimate destiny lay right before her very eyes. 
		
		Could this be the answer she has been searching for? Or has she been remiss not to search? Will this lead her to the questions that will shape her truth?*

		*No, not even emptiness fills her now in this ineffable state of profuse confusion and awkward embarrassment. What was she in fact expecting? Why this elaborate setup for nothing? 
		
		Anti-climactic, perhaps, but then again, expectation is the mother of disappointment.*

		*Thus, perhaps out of shame, or perhaps due to some insight yet to be understood, Eidos decides to sleep. Leaden eyelids succumb to gravity, sealing out the radiance of the crystals. And slowly, as Eidos' Falseflesh collapses upon the disc, so too does her Trueflesh fall into a deep slumber.*

		*A faint sound whispers into her ear, alerting her to the presence of trickling water ahead. Licking her chapped lips, Eidos does her best to ignore the insistent pangs of thirst, but still quickens her pace toward the enticing sound. A lightening of her surroundings gives birth to a dim vision of the jagged rocks that have torn her clothes and skin. 
		
		Abruptly, the tunnel opens into a large cavern, made visible by sparse, delicate beams of sunlight cast through cracks in the ceiling. Another passage leads from this chamber beyond, but most importantly, a small trickle of water runs down a crack in one of the far walls. 
		
		The light unveils one more surprise, for a glimmer from the other side of the curtain of sun rays steals her attention: eyes, hawk-like, piercing through both darkness and light. Reclining against a stone across the chamber sits their owner in silent vigil, motionless, relentless.*

		*The canyon widens and it seems that a massive mound of bones has accumulated over countless generations. The shape and size of the thousands of skulls leaves no doubt that these are decayed and decaying humans. The mound is piled high at the west side of the canyon, but the bleached remains spill out to cover most of the clearing. Perhaps most seek not to venture beyond this point?
		
		Looking skyward, Eidos can see an the glimmering sparkle of the imposing silver spire towering high above. The shining steeple casts dancing reflections from the sun across the grisly hill of death. The canyon floor is near invisible from the bones that litter the ground, in a scattered tumult of memories and dreams now lost to time, but held on to by the living who come to honor them.
		
		However, this place is not devoid of life. Indeed, two armed guards stand before her, vigilantly monitoring her every move. Eidos can see another, unarmed individual further in, prostrating himself before a smaller, separate pile of bones.*
