		*A shy fog glides through the cedar forest, obscuring visibility while simultaneously amplifying the ambient light. Earthy scents mixed with the trees' natural perfume ride on gentle breezes, offering a welcome relief from the dank underhalls of the Enclave. None of his Order ever truly need to set foot outside, save for the Itinerant caste on their recruitment missions, and as such, Ormenos finds himself alone among the coniferous denizens of this woodland refuge. The woody giants' canopy high above blocks most of the sun's attempts to coat the earth with its rays. Those streams of light which do manage to cut through the cedars' dancing limbs, sway hypnotically in time with the shifting breezes.*

		*The birds soon sing out their grievances regarding their unwanted visitor's presence. Ormenos is an intruder in their land, just as he always seems to be no matter where he goes. Indeed, it was in great part this feeling of perpetual pariahood which led him to join the Order in the first place.*

		*And so Ormenos' mind finally shifts to his home. Jeran township limits are only a day's trek through this ancient forest. But none come this way, as the Enclave have done their part to make sure the Forest of Deception deserves its name. Those not of the Order never penetrate the forest. Unsanctioned entry guarantees a loss of all sense of direction, leaving the would-be interloper to simply return to their point of origin.*

Thus, Thetian boldly decides to embark on his journey toward an uncertain future with Ormenos.
		
		He quickly chases after his fellow Jeran, racing to keep pace. Soon the two lock steps, the unmistakable unison of a collective mind.*

		*Exiting the underhalls of the Enclave, Ormenos comes upon the ancient compound's spacious courtyard. A vast gash in this mountain's skin high above bleeds light down onto an arrangement of stones rippling out from a central Muninn. Opposite the Stone Circle, a set of lustrous gates split the two halves of the granite bulwark; beyond these, the outside world chugs along, blissfully ignorant of the Enclave's existence. The walls ridged crown allows minor and fleeting incursions from the light, but little else can penetrate so mighty a defense.*

		*Only near the Stone Circle and the great bulwark is the light sufficient to keep at bay the encroaching shadows. All illumination here otherwise faces summary annihilation as it collides with the darkness; thus, the true dimensions of this place remains an utter mystery. Though the artificial light from a crystalline lattice could easily rectify the deficiency, the Order's forebearers had always preferred the courtyard's shadowy shroud, and the current roster of magi seem ill-inclined to alter this willful oblivion.*

It is this very state Ormenos has fled from ever since he could remember; it is this same state that impelled him to seek out knowledge, so that he may rid himself of the horrifying uncertainty that has stalked him since birth.*
