		*As Eidos enters this chamber, she sees nothing, hears nothing and feels... nothing. It is as though space and time came to an abrupt halt at the edge of this portal. And though her senses tell her nothing exists beyond this gate, her Trueflesh knows better. Yet her 'awareness' and her 'Awareness' must first be reconciled, for some secrets must remain so until adequate preparation takes place.*

		*Stepping through the portal, Eidos' blood rushes groundward like a leaden waterfall. Deprived of oxygen, her mind begins to warp sound and vision into chaotic nightmares. Her limp body falls knees first, head subsequently colliding with the pitiless stone floor abruptly halting her descent. Lying prone against the cold surface, she breathes shallow, desperate breaths.*

		*Ever so slowly, blood flows to her starved mind, bringing in tow gifts of pain from bruised knees and cut skin. Laying one palm flat against the ground, she props herself up. Yet this hand is not the delicate and youthful one she knows; it is as though she has entered a withering body, pale and wrinkled skin peeling off to reveal large swaths of dry, coal-black flesh.*

		*Turning her attention to the surroundings, she notes that the space itself is a near-perfect hemisphere, its surface lined with a mosaic of sooty stone shards, each containing a pulsating spiral dimly glowing within. Countless spirals have been zealously carved into every last bit of the downward sloping floor, all forming part of a massive macro-spiral. Light, spirals and everything else converges at the center where an obsidian altar stands recessed deep into the ground.*

		*Her vision now begins to overlap with an older, deeper memory - though it feels no less immediate. She witnesses the cracking of a reddish wall and the discovery of the cell in which she stands: a great labor wrought by the fell hands of ruined beings. She recalls examining the altar itself, carved of a black rock so dark as to consume all light and admit no reflection. Its dimensions are dizzying and impossible to discern unless seen from all angles simultaneously, a paradoxical geometry beyond normal space and one only revealed or understood through the fusion of this alien recollection and her own perspective.*

		*Eidos plummets blindly into the reeking corruption of the abyss, her descent measured only in the accelerating beats of her panicked heart. With a squish, a heap of putrefied waste softens her fall, the vomit-inducing stench of which compels Eidos to contribute the contents of her stomach to it. Eidos extricates herself from the pile and now tries as best she can to remove the filth from her traveling robes and hair, but to little avail.
		
		Her eyes, now accustomed to the low-light surroundings, spy a speck of light, emanating from directly in front of her.
		
		Running her hands along the slime-sheathed wall, Eidos senses its tubular curvature. A gust of air rushes over her like a waterless river. Turning away from the pinpoint of light she feels the origin of this airborne stream flowing from somewhere deep within the darkness.*

		*Every step through the festering sewage brings her closer to the sunlit aperture. The stench starts to dissipate as a dry wind is exhaled at the mouth of the passage up ahead. When she arrives at her destination, she finds her escape from the Cess Pit to be a hollow victory; for while Eidos finds that she can indeed see the outside world from here, the sewage outflow empties downward from an impossibly high precipice.
		
		Though the drop is sheer and lacks cracks or handholds of any kind, she is at least now permitted a view of her whereabouts: to her left is a distant, but apparently massive mountain range; while forward and to her right is a vast, empty flatland that seems to extend off into infinity; and finally, directly below are the ruins of an ancient twin city to the one she now stalks, terminating at the sheer cliff Eidos now looks out from.
		
		Though difficult to tell how high up she is, it is certain that to attempt such a leap in the face of guaranteed death would be little more than an act of blind faith - or perhaps just a misguided attempt at meeting her maker.*

		*In this waking dream, her form is shrouded in a blue cloak, making it impossible to identify the Trueflesh behind these memories. Nevertheless, a companion dressed in a green hood and traveling robe is clearly visible at her side - even in spite of the absolute darkness.
		
		They walk the chamber with eyes that seem to parse the darkness, revealing the dungeon's shape and dimensions while its detail and definition remain obscured. Before them is a flickering image, like a sculpture carved in a frozen, colorless fire that drops its tenuous shadow from higher dimensions. 
		
		It is, in form, a female, casting a sightless stare upon the two as they advance towards her grim throne. She is flanked by a single attendant: a small child of indeterminate sex, with an invisible emerald aura about it.*

These others now appear at the forefront of her mind's eye. The Thing becomes entangled in the knots Jormungund ties around it. It struggles, to no avail, and only tightens the great serpent's constricting body. And in perfect synergy, Fenrir emerges from the Graylands to sate his hunger. Chomping, swallowing, gnawing, crushing, he consumes. However, he fills his bottomless belly without satisfaction. Eidos yet senses his desire for prey of a higher order.

They are Glyphs of Awareness revealing two paths from this dungeon - one promises a transient safety in the light; whereas the other makes bold claims of long forgotten secrets buried amidst the shadows.*

		It looks as though this place may once have mirrored the Hall of Vanargand, as it is similarly festooned with alcoves for statues. However, the statues within are completely unrecognizable, having been rendered into nothing but misshapen stumps of rock.*

		*Prominent among the drab surroundings, a shimmering, emerald-green fountain stretches several stories high. Its sheen suggests a metallic construction, but its resilience and lack of corrosion defy this conclusion. Rather, it looks to be cut from dimly luminescent jade and sculpted into the shape of some leafy, unfolding plant, caught between the worlds of nature and artifice. A small stream of coppery water trickles from its blossoms, staining the fountain's surface.*

No gaps, nor joints divide the surface, giving the impression that the walls were pulled up from the very ground they now stand upon, pinched into position by some godly hand. The surface is enmeshed throughout by twisting bands of shimmering metal, the outlined scales of a gargantuan beast, girding an inner skin of stone.
		
		The walls, however, are in alliance with a rather unlikely bedfellow. The sole opening in them is guarded by a makeshift gate that seals the entry portal to the city. The gate is as dissimilar to the walls as a Sentry is to a Warbeast. Like a buralp patch on a silk dress.*

The interlocking stone plates are as scales of a gargantuan beast, girding an inner skin of steel.

		The dream becomes manifest as her mere thought drives the undead legions upon the city. They rush towards the gate and begin to scale it with a simian grace, heedless of the blows raining down upon them by weapons of stone and glass. The guards at the top are flung from their makeshift battlements to their definitive end. They become the envy of their fellows once Eidos' vanguard rips open gates, granting access to the rest of the slavering masses of draugnir and Neverborn.

		*The stone cracks like eggshells as Eidos walks through the ruined streets of Ur'Ruk. Up ahead, she sees a building of curious make. Columns built up from loose bricks and stones have been carefully piled into low supports without the use of mortar. Between them, large panes of clear crystal have been dragged from the shattered structures and placed in between these mounds to form a crude, though functional greenhouse.*

		*Eidos walks into the confines of the structure and is nearly overwhelmed with beautiful sight and refreshing smell of the environs. In contrast to the dusty, lifeless cityscape, this place is as an oasis in the desert.
		
		The trickling sound of flowing water and the defiant green of leafing plants leave doubt as to whether this be a phantasm of a treacherous mind. Yet, as the pungent stench of night soil assaults her nose, all questions vanish and the garden cements its place firmly in Eidos' reality.*

virgin entrance

		*The makeshift gate closing behind her, Eidos now finds herself in a space that dwarfs its entrance by comparison. A domed ceiling arcs overhead, its fading blue color giving the impression of a fabricated sky, complete with clouds and birds in flight. Dully shining crystalline sconces adorn the walls, and work hard to chase away the shadows.
		
		Some stubborn darkness yet remains, however, and countless statues now stare at her from their shadowy alcoves. Irreparably scarred from their war with time, all of the carvings are now faceless and most seem little more than amorphous stone pillars. A number of sharp edges hint at the angular and idealized forms they were born with, but whatever artistry or feeling they may have once been imbued with has long since been devoured by the city's ruin.*

		*Nearly invisible at first, she soon detects the first signs of life, for standing along the edges of the hall, in imitation of the statues behind them, is a cadre of men. Their crudely cobbled cudgels impart the sense that they are guardians, though their bearing belies their inexperience. Likewise mirroring the stones they seek to mimic is the deathly pallor of their skin – a pallor with which she is now most personally acquainted.
		
		A granite table stands as the centerpiece of the hall - though it appears to be entirely ceremonial, as there are none sitting at it save a stately lady gazing down upon Eidos from on high. At her side, a lone attendant kneels.
		
		The leader beckons Eidos, firmly and matronly, without bothering to rise from her chair.*

		*Before Eidos can react, the guards converge upon her from behind and cast a net, entangling her entirely. They act with utmost speed and stealth in the perfect unison of a well-oiled machine.
		
		This is the inevitable fate of the nail that sticks out: it is hammered down to conform or removed entirely and replaced with one more suitable. Perhaps this is the only way to survive in the Wastes.*

Many of the large, monolithic paving slabs have been shattered by some long-forgotten cataclysm, the road they form stretching out indefinitely before her. Myriad broken buildings lining the road hint at a bustling and crowded city - or rather the memory thereof. Now the city is populated by only a scant few souls, some of whom seem to haunt a residential area up ahead.*

But one structure, a mighty, blood-red spire far off in the distance, miraculously remains unaffected by the waste and ruin plaguing Ur'Ruk. Though the dusty haze of the city corrupts her view, the untouched crimson tower stands resolute and whole, like a watchful guard over a forlorn graveyard.*

		Eidos enters and scans the area. Only the exceedingly old and the uselessly young seem to be present at the moment. Of greater note, though, is that no walls exist to neatly divide the living spaces. Indeed, the Ur'Rukians seem to have a communal living arrangement in the extreme and likely lack an understanding of the concept of personal space and privacy...

		*The man hands the statue to Eidos for her to take a look.
		
		The effigy is carved of polished black granite. While it is clear that at one time this item was once an object of great beauty, age has worn away many of its finer details. Nonetheless, its most significant details yet shine through: it is a voluptuous female figure of distended belly, bearing six faces and her body is covered in its entirety with circles.*

		*The man hands the tome to Eidos for her to examine.
		
		The leather is cracked and worn, but it seems to be some kind of travel journal. The tome has folds and straps to protect and cover the yellowing pages, yet it is small enough to carry with relative ease. Upon opening it, Eidos sees pages written in a familiar, yet indecipherable, gibberish. An attempts to coax its secrets from the unknown script would be as productive as a debate with a draugnir.*

She has entered an enclosed chamber some hundred paces squared, yet nearly the entire space is occupied by a curious apparatus. Five thrones stand arranged around a circular metallic platform, each of them facing inward and toward the others. The metal seal is reminiscent of the one upon which she spawned. The thrones are stained with the charred shadows of humanoid figures, burned onto the smooth metal seats.
		
		In one of the walls, an artificial aperture peers out into a cavern larger than the city sprawled out above it. A greenish phosphorescence lines the cavern walls, dully glowing like the dying embers of a fire. As she scans the cavern, Eidos notices five spheres of absolute darkness hovering mid-air. Their visual appearance is rather peculiar, almost as if they were not blackened objects, but rather the utter absence of any matter whatsoever. It is thus impossible to see if they are truly convex spheres or simply concave dimples in the fabric of existence.
