		*The austerity of this building's exterior does not mislead: as without, so within. Before her is a single great hall, nearly unadorned and filled solely with shelves of tomes and rows of copying desks. While the vaulted ceiling is impressive, no intricate designs detail its supports.*

		*Yet even in spite of its aesthetic dearth, the pearly, glowing tree at the Archives' center shrouds the room in a dreamlike haze. A bark of marble white covers its thick limbs, limbs which creep about the entirety of the Archives, stretching out like some sylvan giant just waking from its lengthy slumber. From cracks in its aged hide, bulbous crystalline protrusions pulse with a pale, white incandescence, casting rays of light about the structure.*

		*Eidos strolls around the Archives, from shelf to shelf and tome to tome. Yet, with so much of the space occupied by the tree, it seems as though there is a relative poverty of written resources in this place. Many of the shelves lie empty and Eidos estimates that only roughly half the space is being filled with tomes.
		
		During her exploration, she also finds hints of a storied past when the Archives were alive with decorations. The now all but barren walls, were clearly once painted with murals that have faded with the passage of time. Large swathes have been completely erased, but here and there a splash of color or a fleck of gilding betrays their former glory.*

		*Her eyes lock onto one of the more intact murals. At first, it appears to be a stylistic representation of the massive tree dominating this very hall. Yet, there are a great number of differences both subtle and profane. In the faded fresco, the tree's roots are visible, seeming to sprout from the body of a woman buried beneath the tree. Red veins run through the roots, up the trunk, and blossom forth from the branches as crimson leaves. These stand in contrast to the silvered foliage of the Archives' own tree.*

It looks as though there are a great number of them, working their way from the roots of the tree to the bleached halo atop it. Many of them are unrecognizable, but all feel familiar, kindred. However, only one speaks to her directly; superimposed over the white halo is the Glyph of Awareness, with which her Sigil of the same name now resonates.*

		*The heavy wood grates against the desert sand as the gates to Tambul close. Before Eidos is a large courtyard bustling with activity. Contrary to what the towering walls and mighty gates suggest, though, there is a scant and ill-equipped military presence.
		
		For the most part, the life of the townsfolk dominates the environs. Market merchants peddle wares; men pull carts transporting foodstuffs; women haul buckets of water and sacks of soil; children play, running about with great frivolity; older folk engage in lively conversation; and at the epicenter of all activity is a large, marble sculpture - some depiction of an unnamed hero slaying an unusual beast.
		
		Many within proximity to the gates take notice of Eidos. Some pretend to go about their business while cautiously drawing nearer to regard her, but none approach overtly. One of them in particular, a youthful, red-headed girl, stands staring for a moment, only to then run off down the street with great urgency.*

Nearing the marble sculpture, it becomes clear that it is a fountain, jets of water both misting and bubbling from underneath.
		
		Suddenly, an elderly man calls out to her, as he waddles towards her.*

		*The guards escort Eidos to the gates, signaling to their attendants with a nod to open them. The heavy wooden doors grind the sand beneath to even finer powder, revealing a blistering hellscape of flat, cracked earth, dusted in sparkling grains of sand beyond them. Eidos looks back once more into the Atrium. While many of the folk cast a mix of furtive, fearful and curious looks in her direction, there is one visage that is a mask of passionless intensity: Pakahron's piercing stare burns into her eyes like smoldering coals. In the sea of meek faces, he stands as a man alone.

		Passing through the gates, they immediately groan shut behind her.*

		*A large statue perched upon a fountain dominates the center of the Atrium. Eidos instantly gravitates towards the cool mist rising from jets of water spraying at its feet, hoping to offset the effects of the relentless sun. Upon closer inspection, what looked to be a statue of marble turns out to be some kind of metallic one instead - iron or steel, but white in hue. Remarkably, it lacks any sign of corrosion, despite its proximity to water. The metal bends and twists, depicting an armored hero locked in the throes of battle with a fantastical creature - some strange fusion of serpent, lion, and bird, and other unfamiliar creatures.
		
		This statue seems to serve as a gathering place and most people around here seem engaged in lively conversation. However, a good number seem to merely be countering the midday heat with the fountain's misty coolness.*

Hundreds of buildings hide behind these walls, shyly poking the tips their roofs above the ramparts.

		*Their interaction at an end, Eidos is left alone to reflect upon her surroundings. Sweet, humid air fills her lungs and gives her racing mind a moment of respite. A veritable sea of plants spreads out before her eyes, a sea of green, with flecks of colorful fruits and vegetables peppered throughout. All is silent but for the song of the nearby worker ringing gently around this section of the farm.*

Though yet within this man-made haven, protected by its glassy shield, this hint of greater mysteries without beckons her. She feels it, the birth of a formless thought, an epiphany.

Her naked thoughts exposed to the prying intellect of Pakahron, Eidos knows that he sees it all, absorbs it all, experiences it as though it were his very own actions. And thus, what was once uniquely Eidos' has now become communal property.
		
		The illusory operation has left unprotected the sole safe haven Eidos possessed. If this is what the denizens under a mage experience, it is no wonder they show such obedience, since their privacy depends on the mage's whims.*

MOON KEEP

		||
		*Eidos walks towards the silver spire towering over the township of Tambul. From this vantage point, it is difficult to tell how this structure was built. By all appearances, it is composed of a number of interlocking plates, though there are no signs of rivets or welds - the seams are more aesthetic choice than pragmatic necessity.
		
		This brilliant spire stands in stark contrast to the fortification that surrounds it. Blocks of sandstone form a modest keep around the tower, with walls both thick and high. The gates leading from the residential area and into the keep stand open, implying all have access to it.*

		*Walking through the keep structure, Eidos enters a courtyard. The shimmering, doorless gate here permits a limited view of the canyon. While the sight of this deep scar in the earth’s skin is truly breath-taking, it is eclipsed by the feat of unfathomable engineering spanning it, Heaven's Bridge.
		
		Likely wrought by the same hands responsible for the Moon Tower, this bridge too consists of perfectly interlocking metallic pieces, like scales on an impossibly large serpent. Stretching out across the chasm, it slithers through the air absent any support structures and yet miraculously remains solid and unmoving.
		
		The sight is made even stranger by virtue of the massive archway hanging over the bridge entrance. There is some kind of visual distortion bending light at the threshold, as if a thin film of superheated air hung suspended between the metal pillars.
		
		Eidos sees that the courtyard wraps around the tower and that there is a staircase leading to the top of the ramparts overlooking the canyon.*

So wide is it, that its circular base seems to draw a straight line in either direction. So unfathomably tall is it, that its top appears to taper to a single point upwards into infinity.
		
		The tower, however, is less inviting than the keep, as its front door is closed and flanked by guards. Eidos sees no way to access the bridge from here, but soon spies what appears to be a path leading around to the back of the tower.*

		She climbs and climbs until she reaches a landing atop the walls, and the vistas it affords.
		
		Casting her gaze out over the canyon, she absorbs the wonders of the landscape both natural and artificial. To the east, a sprawling fortress stands between her and a black point melting into the horizon. To the north of the inky dot is a sea of sparkling white. To the south, nothing but dust and sand.

		*Once on the landing, Eidos looks out over all the familiar sights. The canyon out east, the fortress at the end of the bridge, that inky spot in the middle of the dust and sand, and the sparkling white north of it. Suddenly curious about the window, Eidos looks up and sees only a flat, seamless scale in its place, almost as if its very existence had been stricken from reality.*

		*Night has fallen upon the region of Kabu and only a handful of torches and crystals illuminate scattered patches of the ramparts. Assala scales the walls with a simian-like grace, disappearing over the top. Moments later, a length of rope crawls down the wall and Assala signals Eidos to grab hold. Upon doing so, Eidos is rapidly hoisted up to the top by Assala's absurd strength. The two, now standing in the Tambulan mortuary, begin to slowly descend toward the gate via a cramped stairwell.*

		*Assala signals Eidos to hold her position as she glides over to subdue the solitary guard manning the gate. Her hand quietly slips over the guard's mouth as her knife silently slips across his neck. Before his limp Falseflesh hits the ground, Assala is already moving to disarm the gate. She removes the amethyst controlling the barrier from its casing. In complete silence, the barrier disappears, affording them the chance to steal across the bridge towards the Sun Keep and the Dawn Fortress beyond.*

Without a break in his step, he advances forward to engage the threat that now menaces his people.*

		*One hand on the rope, the other reaches up to grab hold of the windowsill. Pulling herself up and over the sill feels just as difficult as the entire climb had up to that point. Eidos breathes slowly, smoothly and relaxes her tensed muscles. She then quickly surveys the room and notices that among the myriad crystals and various whatnots is a shelf, packed with tomes. Then, scanning for the person she pursued up this spire, she sees him replacing a crystal in among a whole wall of them. Sensing her presence, the man turns and looks right at her, sizing her up, evaluating how much of a threat she may pose.*

A circle manifests, weaving an intricate tapestry of lines, never crossing, as they traverse dimensions linking paths among them. And soon, the Glyph of Fenrir is fully formed, completing the reaction.

		*As Eidos alights at the top of the stairs, she arrives at another, smaller courtyard, this one covered with a thatch roof. In the shade stands a man, decked out in a heavy leather apron and matching leather gloves, both with dark splotches splattered all over. At the center is a blanketed object resting upon a table. The man, walks over towards the table and begins to peel off the covering, revealing a rather grim sight.*

		*The bloated corpse of a dead man lies there, wan and motionless. Though miraculously the stench of death is absent. Hung upon the walls are numerous concoctions, some bubbling absent fire, others constantly shifting color, but not a single unremarkable one among them.
		
		The man attending the body is in his middle years. Heavyset and mustachioed, he looks more butcher than mortician. He performs his chores with the utmost precision and detachment, cleaning the cadaver and then rubbing ointments all over it.
		
		Large gashes made in the neck indicate the body has been drained of blood prior to this treatment ritual. Several corpses strung upside down over a vat at the far end of the area serve to confirm this suspicion.*

		*Eidos enters a veritable forest of multi-tiered buildings, its depth unknowable from here. Walking among the houses, she runs her hand along the rough surface of their walls, fingers catching where layered bricks peek out from cracks in the adobe.
		
		Though mostly monochromatic and uniform, the residences distinguish themselves by simple yet colorful placards framing what could well be names and occupations. Dary, Loremaster. Dysron, Cultivator. Kagesh, Guardian. But then, she reaches one with the name defaced. Scratched through with a single line, Zebh, Cultivator was once written upon it.*

		*Nearby she spots a building similar in shape and construction to the Temple. People enter and exit freely, many carrying leatherbound tomes to and from it. Then, to the west is the hustle and bustle of the Atrium. Further east, the silver spire looms over Tambul like a derisive overseer, glowering with unseen eyes. And to the north, a building unlike the others in both hue and architecture peeks above the tops of the residences. The building appears as though honeycombed with light or reflections thereof, but only on its northern side.*

		*Eidos steps into the diminutive chamber, swimming through a crimson haze. Giving the room its reddish hue is a shining crystal, offered up by the hands of a statue kneeling in supplication, a look of ecstasy etched upon its stony face. 
		
		Eidos sees that, even in spite of the crimson filter, the frescoes in this small room stand with all the clarity those outside must have once possessed. They depict a great number of folk sitting at the feet of a violet-robed figure, orbs of light hovering above his palms. Deep within the orbs themselves, fiery Glyphs float as if in a viscous fluid.*

		*In an inadvisable acquiescence to her baser nature, Eidos casts the crystal to the ground. It shatters, releasing its energetic contents. Luin, true to its word, envelops her with his diamond skin.
		
		Unfortunately for Eidos, the collapsing ceiling pins her against one of the walls. Crackling fires and screaming survivors punctuate the confusion of the aftermath. Then the mephitic fumes of burning tomes start to worm their way through the rubble towards her, leaving Eidos to die of asphyxiation. She persists for a time before apoxia's effects overwhelm her desire to live. She sleeps and her ghost succumbs to the magnetic pull of the Graylands.*
