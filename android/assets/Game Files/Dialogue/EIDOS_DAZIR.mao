		*Bones and sinew weave a shell as they are rebuilt from the life-fire of the Nether Edge. The light dims and Eidos feels that she now stands knee deep in water. Lowering her gaze, she finds that she is indeed standing upon a submerged Farcaster seal, however it looks as if a white marble fountain has been constructed around it.*

		*Stepping from the watery seal, Eidos sits upon the marbled fountain and empties the intrusive water from her leg bindings. The cold yet gentle winds chill her soaked feet, causing her skin to tighten and her muscles to stiffen. Only after retying her bindings does she begin to truly examine her surroundings, a finely manicured Arboretum greeting her curious eyes. While there are rows of plants and the air is rich with the perfume of flowers, its appearance differs greatly from the garden of the Nether Edge. Its stately look, as if it has been fussed over a great deal, and lack of any sense of wildness stands in stark contrast to the Nether Edge.*

		*It looks as if there are two structures on opposing sides of the lengthy Arboretum. One looks humble and utilitarian, with a simple domed roof and narrow windows, a hundred paces or so to her left. The other is an opulent building, a residence perhaps, fifty paces to her right.*

		*Eidos soon observes that this surreal oasis of perfection stands amid the backdrop of craggy peaks to the west and a desert expanse extending indefinitely toward the east. A series of three aqueducts lead from the austere mountains down into the desert flats with one terminating right above the very Arboretum in which she stands. This one empties into a massive reservoir of pristine water. Several pipes seem to funnel the water off to parts unknown.*

		With a start, she shakes clear her self-imposed petrification, and with a surprising quickness in her step, scuttles briskly forward.*

However, long before she arrives, the front door swings open, revealing what could only be the master of the house: a man dressed in fine, black silk and a feathered hat, his nose hawk-like, and protruding out over a mouth twisted in a perpetual scowl. His eyes are sharp and aware, not the eyes of a surprised man.*

		*Eidos enters a space of a decisively religious quality. Though this place is clearly no temple, it has a preternatural and deific atmosphere. Perhaps it is the crystals casting a warm, filtered light, selectively illuminating unused desks and tomes; or perhaps it is the absence of humanity and the solitude of silence. Maybe it is the curious juxtaposition of overflowing knowledge with a dearth of learners.	Whatever the case may be, this is a sanctum from the outside world. It is the outside world. A microcosm of the universe across time, compressed into single space. Simply here, frozen still, as it continually flows. Created just for her singular contemplation.*

		*Continuing her advance into the sanctum, Eidos observes the surroundings. The most stunning feature of this space is also the most dominant: a gargantuan tree, of ivory white, with an infinity of branches reaching high into the air and sprouting countless shining silvered leaves. Its roots are perfectly concealed beneath the tiled floors, with mere hints of them penetrating at regular intervals.
		
		Crystalline protrusions peek through cracks in the pale bark, bizarre emanations of energistic waves pouring forth from them. At first these peculiar growths look to be splitting the wood with their angular mineral geometry. However, upon further scrutiny Eidos notes that a sparkling sap surrounds these protrusions, giving the impression that the crystals are in fact the congealed lifeblood of the plant's structure.*

		*Eidos shuffles forth and places her palm upon one of the bulbous protrusions, immediately feeling the presence of a deep intellect. Speaking with a wordless voice, Eidos is drawn into communion with the mind of the tree. The whisper seems unintelligible to her linguistic call, though its voice seems strikingly familiar. As if picking up a conversation with an old friend, new memories begin to blossom within her mind. The tree weaves tales of ancient travelers, myths of proto-societies and many other stories, passionately told and devoutly remembered.*

		*The entire archive seems carefully constructed to contain the tree's massive shape. The dimensions seem insufficient to allow further growth and most of the illumination seems to emanate from the subtly swaying leaves, blown by a wind only they sense.
		
		Walking around the perimeter reveals the austere, dark stone to be mostly unadorned but for a fresco at the side opposite the entrance. The painting looks to be a representation of the tree itself, though there are a number of notable discrepancies. While the leaves that hang from the branches above her are a pale silver, this tress seems to be in a full, green, springtime bloom. A yellow sun shines down from on high and a black bird is nestled among the boughs.
		
		Drawn over the tree are a series of circles in which many and varied shapes abide. They appear to have the look of Glyphs, though their function in this work is merely aesthetic, apparently conveying neither meaning nor power.*

		Walking around the perimeter reveals the austere, dark stone to be mostly unadorned but for a fresco at the side opposite the entrance. The painting looks much the same as the one she viewed in the Tambulan Archive, what feels like lifetimes ago. However, there are a number of notable discrepancies. While the leaves that hung from the branches in the Tambulan image were crimson, these are a full, green, springtime bloom. A white halo as a brilliant yellow sun, shines down from on high. The two crows from the other township are absent, replaced by but a single black bird, nestled among the boughs.

		*The door creaks as it opens, leading in to the crystal-lit Archives. An impossible feeling of familiarity. An ineffable connection to this scene. Though she has never been here before, Eidos remembers it. Perhaps the world may not remember, yet the knowledge of the Muninn Tree has not forgotten. The Interstice records all possible paths taken, giving each weight and significance. The knowledge now within her, assimilated to the will of one, now remembers its origins. It traces its leaves back to its branches, its trunk to its roots, its roots to its seed. And in so doing, it transcends.
		
		Knowledge is not powerful because of its origins, but rather because of its intrinsic truth. Though the fool may stumble upon the same truths as the wiseman, they would be no less authentic in essence.*

		*Walking beside the waist-high walls of this central level, Eidos leaves the plaza and reaches a residential district. Tiered buildings of carefully stuccoed adobe bricks face out toward an ambivalent desert. The level itself looms over the lowest area of the township, but rests under the watchful gaze of Khaa's garden and the menacing mountains beyond. Looking down, this vantage point offers an unobstructed view of the imposing gates, the majestic temple and the wretched slums of the lowest level.*

		*Turning her attention to the denizens, Eidos witnesses a number of people transiting through here, all dressed in varying shades of turquoise. Several among them seem to be engaged in lively debate regarding crystals or Vanquished mechanisms. Near the walls, a contingent of particularly mischievous children throwing rocks down into the slums are summarily punished by a group of frowning adults.*

		*Then inspecting the residences themselves, Eidos notes the finely painted mosaics adorning the entrances. Soft colors and frivolous themes give the area a sense of tranquility. Further enhancing this relaxed atmosphere are the cushioned benches lining the walls, shaded by blooming decorative trees. Masterfully sculpted fountains sit outside each door providing a continual flow of fresh water. Thirsty passersby stop to fill ornate flasks and then drink deeply under the scorching desert sun.*

His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.

ARTISANS' PLAZA

		*All around Eidos is a bustling plaza. Dominating the area is a marble fountain several stories tall and well over one hundred paces in diameter. A number of conversing turquoise-clad pairs stroll around the fountain, while a few individuals sit upon the fountain's lip and in its shade, seeking refuge from the midday sun.*

		*Myriad pillars rise from the ground, supporting nothing but the open sky. They are all covered in remarkably beautiful mosaics depicting the history of the Daziran people - notable among them is one of a gallant female mage wielding a verdant spear as she charges into battle against pale, drooling abominations.*

		*One whole side of the area is open to the desert, allowing for a spectacular panoramic view of the desolate landscape - though to the south, constant dust cyclones kick up airborne sediment obscuring any distant landmarks. However, looking out from the mountains toward the east, a silver tower rejects the sun's rays, at once inviting and forbidding perception with its blinding reflections. The township beneath it is barely visible amid the brilliance.*

		*As Eidos' victim falls to the tiles of the plaza floor, shouts from the Workshop herald the arrival of Khaa, mage of Dazir. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

ATRIUM
	[/KABU!DAZIR!ATRIUM!0.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*Eidos stands in the atrium. The air is thick with the sounds and smells of a local bazaar. No trees, no bushes, in fact no vegetation in sight at all makes the area look a bit stale and artificial. The upper tiers of the township loom over this lowest tier as a great awning, like a rocky cloud casting all in a perpetual shadow. Only the expansive atrium near the city walls escapes its gloomy cover.*

		||
		*Looking about at the vendors' stalls, Eidos notices a dearth of merchandise. Peddled wares do trade hands - but at what price, Eidos cannot surmise as both merchant and buyer appear to find the agreement disagreeable. Many locals walk about awkwardly avoiding the conspicuous foreigner's gaze. Even of the people who do not actively flee her, most are aloof and dismissive of her presence. Others just sit, mumbling to themselves with their haggard and worried faces.*

		||
		*At the eastern edge of the township is a worn adobe wall, cracks visible even from this great distance. The wall roughly a story tall. At its center is what appears to be a gate - so clearly superior in its reflective metallic construction that is seems out of place. The gate itself is sealed by a massive, circular chunk of onyx. At the opposite end of the atrium is a large sandstone temple, which looks to have a number of folk burning incense at its perimeter.*

		*Looking about the Atrium, Eidos surveys the folk. Most all of them seem beleaguered by menial tasks such as transporting goods, materials and water or sorting and preparing foodstuffs.
		
		Those in idleness seem to have their eyes cast upward, looking upon the narrow band of sky visible between the wall and the support structure of the upper level. Only a few seem open to her approach.*

		*The Atrium is hot and muggy through the mixing of the desert heat emanating from the walls and the sweat of the Daziran laborers. Though its perpetual shade under the awning of the upper tiers offers a silver lining.
		
		From here she can walk further into the lower living area towards the sandstone building where people are burning incense. Else, she can walk back to the Gates and the cloudstone Lift nearby.*

		*Approaching the Daziran temple, Eidos notes that its construction is strikingly similar to the domed structure in Khaa's Arboretum. Both are composed of simple but finely carved sandstone blocks, placed so precisely that even the finest blade would find no space to fit. Sturdy. Solid. But then again, so are most buildings in Dazir, even here on the lowest level.
		
		There are a number of golden-robed folk burning incense and chanting incantations at the door. Still others enter the structure with empty urns, passing those on their way out who carry overflowing jars, water splashing to the ground from their frivolous maneuvering.
		
		Beyond the temple itself seems to be a somewhat more dilapidated area of town, with people of equal caliber loitering around the area.*

		*As Eidos' victim falls to the packed dirt of the Atrium grounds, shouts from the cloudstone Lift herald the arrival of Khaa, mage of Dazir. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape. 
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

Its operation, though seemingly understood by the Dazirans, is clearly not replicable by them or their ilk. The artifact is as alien to them as immortality, or perhaps as strange as omniscience.

		A spacious workshop then comes into view, filled with workbenches and tools ranging from crudely fashioned metallic implements to genuinely magical artifacts. The voices heard previously belong to workers and artisans, calling to each other as they coordinate their efforts to birth creations both bizarre and mundane.
		
		Stopping at ground level, Eidos steps forth from the platform.*

Three to four times her height in diameter, it stands dispassionately before her, blocking the archway that serves as the entrance to the township. Canting her head skywards, Eidos sees no presence at the top of the walls, no sign of activity at her approach - though she can faintly hear the sound of human voices distantly echoing from the stone slopes encompassing the township. 
		
		Looking beyond the gate, Eidos sees that vertically stacked tiers recess into the mountain the higher they go. The lowest level is invisible from this vantage point, but the top two levels give hints of the presence of master builders. The structures, though not of Vanquished caliber, are far from crude and the lush vegetation on the upper two levels - especially the uppermost - seem alien to the local desert's desolate flora.

		*Walking up to the walls of Dazir, her trek is halted by a circular slab of dark yet resplendent onyx. Three to four times her height in diameter, it stands dispassionately before her, blocking the archway that serves as the entrance to the township. As she draws nearer, the barricade begins to rise. While there is a loud grating of stone on stone, there is no sound of machinery. As the gate is opened Eidos sees a few scantly armed guards within, gripping their wooden cudgels warily, their eyes looking past Eidos and out onto the Jenowin Plain, as though trying to will the fuming mirages into distinguishable shapes. They are truly on edge.
		
		As soon as she crosses the threshold, the block slowly returns to its resting place, looking for all the world as if it is being gently set down by the hand of some invisible giant.*

		*Walking up to the walls of Dazir, her trek is halted by a circular slab of dark yet resplendent onyx. Three to four times her height in diameter, it stands dispassionately before her, blocking the archway that serves as the entrance to the township. As she draws nearer, the barricade begins to rise. While there is a loud grating of stone on stone, there is no sound of machinery. As the gate is opened Eidos sees a few scantly armed guards within, gripping their wooden cudgels warily, their eyes looking past Eidos and out onto the Jenowin Plain, as though trying to will the fuming mirages into distinguishable shapes. They are truly on edge.
		
		As Eidos is entering, she notices a man is exiting.*

Canting her head skywards, Eidos sees no presence at the top of the walls, no sign of activity at her approach. In fact, a maddening absence of any sound whatsoever suggests the place has been abandoned.
		
		Then the gates yawn with a terrible grating of stone on stone as they open up revealing an armed contingent of guards and a rather extravagantly garbed fellow, walking with the gait of a man trying to hide his painful awareness of his inadequacies.

		Looking beyond the gate, Eidos sees that vertically stacked tiers recess into the mountain the higher they go. The lowest level is invisible from this vantage point, but the top two levels give hints of the presence of master builders. The structures, though not of Vanquished caliber, are far from crude and the lush vegetation on the upper two levels - especially the uppermost - seem alien to the local desert's desolate flora.
		
		Stretching out from the mountains like hardened veins are two stony aqueducts. One leads across the desert towards the settlement with the silver tower, glittering in the east and the other first bends south, then turning sharply toward the east and across the canyon.*

		*As Eidos' victim falls against the unyielding stone of the Daziran gate, shouts from the Atrium herald the arrival of Khaa, mage of Dazir. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

In a fit of ecstasy, as if having achieved her lifelong dream, Eidos lifts the vessel and pours it all over her head, a steady deluge of fresh water dousing her entire person. After shaking herself dry like some farmyard beast, she punctuates the performance with a resounding caw.

His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

Desperate and greedy hands have lain ruin to every object of beauty that was not looted. Nothing remains unsullied or unbroken. Windows shattered. Paintings torn. Statues toppled and fragmented.

		*Walking past the temple, Eidos is greeted by stagnant air, rank with the perfume of sewage. This area is carved directly from the mountain itself, keeping it walled-in on all sides save for the one opening towards the temple and the atrium. Shadows are thicker than their counterparts here, as the second tier acts as an impenetrable roof, finishing of the containment for this forgotten and unwanted segment of Dazir. The architecture here likewise lacks the sophistication of the rest of the township, with the exception of several prodigious pillars used to support the unfathomable weight of the second tier. The most luxurious houses are half-collapsed edifices with tattered rags acting as curtains. All the doors have either rusted off their hinges or broken off until little in the way of wood is left.
		
		Not many people walk about in this place, most choosing to simply hug their shins while murmuring half-hearted lamentations. Those who have the energy to walk around seem to be at loose ends.*

		*Walking through the haze of sacrificial smoke, Eidos enters the dim light of the Temple. While there are some narrow windows up high, the light without is too weak to illuminate the space within. Thus, hundreds of candles light numerous shrines in the wings of the complex, however, the central area is bathed in a cool blue light. At the center of this structure is a gushing fountain, with a thousand points of glittering light shining from the stone beneath the water. 
		
		All people in this site are silent as they approach the font. They prostrate themselves before it, mouth incantations and collect water in their vessels. Whatever is said in these whispering moments is drowned out by the sound of flowing water and remains unheard. The citizenry here seem utterly focused on their water-fetching efforts and one figure alone seems approachable: a man dressed in golden robes - clearly reciprocating a desire to speak, as he now stares intently at Eidos.*

		*As her victim's last breath floats up with the smoke of the burning incense, Eidos can hear shouts from the Slums outside. Soon the lithe figure of Khaa, the mage of Dazir, steps withing the darkened, smoky atmosphere of the Temple. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

		*The battle has taken its toll on Eidos. Having exerted her Falseflesh far beyond its limits, she drops to her knees, breath quickening until she loses all control. Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

		*Grinding wheels, saws, drills, and hammers all work away at stone, wood, metal and glass. Clinking and buzzing. Cracking and snapping. The bizarre percussive symphony moves along at a hypnotic tempo, lulling the worker spirit into a frenzy. As music would make a person want to dance, so too does this instrumental make Eidos want to work. It takes a great force of will to stop herself from rolling up her sleeves and joining in the industrial bacchanal.*

Other rarer items seem to be crystal-driven and also seem to be the most frighteningly powerful among the tools.*

		*Having survived the conversation, Eidos scans the area, noting that most folk here are still completely absorbed in their work.

However, there are evidently more areas on this level to explore outdoors.*

		*As Eidos' victim falls to the dusty Workshop floor, the cloudstone Lift drops from the area above, heralding the arrival of Khaa, mage of Dazir. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*

WORKSHOP EXTERIOR

		*The heat outside the workshop is unbearable. A completely shadowless junkyard, this area appears to serve as a repository for excess materials. Piles of stone and wood litter the cobblestone floor, while great stacks of spooled twine are nestled firmly up against the workshop's walls. Set apart from all miscellany, however, is a great lattice of crystals.
		
		What at first appears to be the blinding reflection from the sun's unforgiving rays instead reveals itself to be the radiant energy housed within the crystals themselves. So bright, so resplendent are they, that Eidos cannot help but avert her tear-filled eyes from them. This lattice appears to be of great importance as it is both isolated from all other areas and boasts a contingent of nearly thirty guards around the perimeter.*

		*A great number of turquoise-robed people mill about the place, ordering others about with grand gestures and stern faces. Those commanded wear heavy work aprons with turquoise bands tied around their upper arms. Mindlessly they obey all orders, moving with a practiced efficiency well beyond the ordinary. Perfectly tuned, well-oiled cogs, they each perform their part flawlessly, giving life to the machinery of Dazir.*

		*At the eastern edge of the junkyard, is a banister overlooking the Jenowin Plain. Several of the aproned workers appear to linger there, taking a rest from their back-breaking labor.
		
		Further north into town is a large plaza, speckled with thick, stone columns jutting out from the floor like the quills of a giant, rocky porcupine. At the center of the plaza is a decadent fountain of massive proportions, towering over the tops of the columns, reaching nearly to the topmost tier of the township.*

		*As Eidos' victim falls to the tiles of the plaza floor, shouts from the Workshop herald the arrival of Khaa, mage of Dazir. His steely eyes stare down an aquiline nose at Eidos, like a raptor locking onto its prey. His face grows paradoxically more relaxed in the cruel scowl that gradually contorts his features, like old leather returning to a comfortable shape.
		
		Confidently, he strides towards her, not even a hint of surprise in his demeanor - this recent death clearly is no news to him. Without even a speck of wastefulness, of time and of movement alike, Khaa's thin frame draws up like a mantis poised to strike...*
