		*Eidos finds herself in an austere amphitheater nestled against the inner wall. Though perhaps the exact antithesis of ostentatious, it is no less remarkable for its impeccable architecture. A smooth, alabaster quarter-dome acts as the stage, a subtly translucent half-dome acting as the roof.
		
		Her footfalls echo from the stone surfaces all about, revealing the reasoning behind the placement of this structure. Surely a voice performing at the center of this stage would clearly reach all ears. Scanning the vacant stone benches, she can almost see a dim afterimage of an enthralled audience, cheering in raucous ecstasy.
		
		Though she knows Tacribians only for a bellicose nature, this area hints at a gentler side - the sheath to their sword.*

		*The brutish grunts of exertion from the nearby Proving Ground call her back to the stark reality of an empty theater. While this place is well-maintained, it is utterly forsaken, but for a solitary man of middle age, dutifully sweeping the area free of dust.*

		*Approaching the amphitheater, Eidos notices a dramatic change in the environs. Standing upon the stage is Kambin and more than a few Tacribians are watching him sing. The walls and the air betwixt him and the audience resonate with the silvery timbre of his voice. It seems he was holding back when at the Hydroponic facility in Tambul.
		
		Even folk in the Proving Ground seem to be taking note of the performance, as those resting look on with approving stares. Qust too has taken pause in his work to look upon the Tambulan cultivator.*

		*Approaching the amphitheater, Eidos notices a dramatic change in the environs. Standing upon the stage is Akkeber, cavorting about and gesticulating wildly as he weaves an epic tale in spoken song. Eidos sees that she is the sole audience member of the Forsaken Poet, as the Tacribians seem eager to ignore his impassioned performance. Even Qust seems to prefer the dust from the steps to the sub-mediocrity of the stage-infecting performer.*

The walls and the air betwixt him and the audience resonate with the silvery timbre of his voice. For better or for worse, he has been joined by Akkeber, who cavorts about as though in the grips of some ecstatic frenzy. Perhaps he is giving an interpretive dance of Kambin's folk song, but it would be impossible to plumb the depths of his unique motivations.
		
		Even folk in the Proving Ground seem to be taking note of the performance, as those resting from exercise look on with a mixture of appreciation and confusion. Qust too has taken pause in his work to look upon the juxtaposition of atrocity and melodiousness.*

		*Eidos sees that there is a great deal of activity transpiring in the Proving Grounds, clearly visible through the nearly translucent dome and equally audible through the doors leading in.
		
		However, in stark relief to the bustling exterior is a seemingly abandoned structure built from dark, brown sandstone. While it is impressive in size, more remarkable is that it bears an austere beauty unparalleled by the other structures of this fortress. Furthermore, the contentious Tacribian aqueduct appears to have emptied into this structure before it ran dry.
		
		Looking to the imposing walls, Eidos sees that there is a staircase leading to the top of the battlements, though no one seems to be using them currently.*

		*Before the middle-aged Tacribian warrior can succumb to injuries, a look of proud determination falls upon a point behind Eidos. Turning about, she sees that summons unheard have called forth the master of this fortress. The sinewy frame of Khlutt, commander of the Tacribian League, now silently glides into the Amphitheater.*

		*The battle has taken its toll on Eidos. Having exerted her Falseflesh far beyond its limits, she drops to her knees, breath quickening until she loses all control. Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

Wordlessly, they move, as though compelled by the unspoken directives of their slain commander, the flame of his instructions still burning brightly within them. Stone-faced, they begin their task, like a cadre of unthinking, unfeeling Neverborn automata.*

While a fair number of tomes line the shelves of this library, the dimensions of this space are far in excess of what would be required to hold such a humble quantity of work.
		
		The center of the chamber's floor is also marked by absence, a dirt-filled but otherwise empty, circular space having been fashioned into the stonework. Numerous milky crystals dot the earth within, all inert. It looks to be in preparation for some structure or decoration that was left unfinished.
		
		Eidos' entrance has aroused the attention of the Archive's sole occupant, a youthful lady with long, fiery hair tightly braided on top with the surplus cascading down upon her shoulders, framing her deep set eyes and prominent check bones.

		*Looking around these adumbral Archives, Eidos sees that there is a sizable fresco painted upon the wall, opposite the front entrance. While it is impossible to determine its age for certain, the art here looks relatively fresh, with vibrant colors visible even in the modest amber light.
		
		The image is of an imposing silver tree with brilliant golden foliage. Its knotted roots are depicted as unfurling like white tendrils down into the tenebrous space beneath. An army of hideous skeletal creatures appear to be assailing the tree, though they are held at bay by a woman wielding a spear painted in a shimmering metallic green.*

		*Looking up the base of the majestic tree, Eidos notes three distinct animals among its branches: a serpent, a crow and, curiously, a wolf. Rays of metallic gold and red are seen radiating from the tree, as though it itself were casting divine light.
		
		Above this, Eidos sees one further image painted in an understated hand, as if an afterthought. Behind the scene a disembodied eye surveys all that is in and around the tree.*

Eidos turns to face Logira only to find a great distance yet between them, bridged by a smoldering stare. It leaves little doubt that further tampering with the device will be met with... resistance, to say the least. Eidos feels compelled to cease her investigation of the switch for now and renews her exploration of the Archives.*

		*No more tomes here seem to her worth committing to memory. From her cursory survey, however, it looks as though much of this Archives' work is concerned with the details of religion, history and accounts of war. These are the words of a folk both lost and resolute.
		
		Leafing through a few select tomes, Eidos notes that the religious texts speak of a removal from home, a loss of past and a confusion of meaning. Many of the prayers seem to belie a distinct sense of an unheeding and unsympathetic heaven. Salvation seems found in the tomes of warcraft, which speak of feats of heroism, cunning, and fellowship in the face of sacrifice. Laced throughout, is a profound sense of resentment at a betrayal that can never be forgiven.*

		*Eidos turns from the shadowy Archives and walks back into the narrow passage whence she came. As she does so, she immediately hears the clanking of some hoary mechanism as it forces the panel of wall to begin sliding back into place behind her. 
		
		Casting one final glance over her shoulder, her final view is of the fleeting silhouette Logira's face carves out in the amber light. As the portal completes its closure, Eidos is embraced by darkness once again. Her path set, there is nowhere to go now, but forward.*

		*Before her words finish echoing throughout the expansive Archives, Logira has already begun to summon a dark and forbidden Techne. 
		
		The emerald haze surrounding her intensifies as it disassembles her Falseflesh, unraveling it into threads of pure energy. These luminescent tendrils absorb the essence of the crystalline illuminators and sparkle with a radiance brighter than the very sun. The incredible amount of energy required for this Techne saps every last shred of life from the room and all begins to wither until it crumbles away into brittle ash.*

		*Logira stands dejected and silent, her eyes an unveiled window to the smoldering anger in her heart. It is not long before the tense silence is broken by the swift clicking sound of hobnail sandals upon the stone steps outside the front entrance. The metal door is kicked open revealing the glowering visage of the Tacribian mage, a small force of his warriors in train. The amber light mockingly plays upon their blades, attacking her sensitive eyes as a prelude to the violence to come. In the span of a heartbeat, the unarmed leader approaches Eidos, bile dripping from the words his snarling mouth now seeks to spit.*

		*The battle has taken its toll on Eidos. Having exerted her Falseflesh far beyond its limits, she drops to her knees, breath quickening until she loses all control. Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

		*Myriad forgotten steps bring the her to living quarters. Here, the midday sun desperately tries to creep in through thin surveillance slits in the walls - though the persistent rays find only limited success, as these barracks seem to mirror the reserved and guarded Tacribians who built them.
		
		A silent stillness rules over this place, as midday is no time for a warrior to be idle, it seems. However, in a far corner, there look to be three occupants engaged in conversation so quiet that Eidos failed to notice their presence until this very moment.*

Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

		*Moving forward from the bridge, Eidos enters a darkened cavern. In the meager sunlight illuminating the mouth of the entrance, it becomes clear that this passage must be artificial. The aperture is a nearly perfect semi-circle carved from the rock and arching support structures added. What's more, two timeworn ruts line the otherwise smooth floor, indicating that this passage once bore some kind of wheeled vehicle.*

		*As she continues down the cavern, what little light the sun could inject dies away completely, forcing her to run her hand along the wall for a sense of direction. She walks through the passage for hours on end, taking her further and further into the northeast. 
		
		In time, she finds another illuminated point, two small crystalline sconces casting their soft, amber light. It is the termination of this passage. Her Eidos finds the ruined remains of an ancient cart, its wooden wheels and frame long-since dissolved to dust leaving only the metal spokes and rims to hint at its former design.*

		*Eidos enters an area dominated by a large pit of cordoned-off sand. The Tacribian warriors here are seen thrusting blunt-ended spears at each other, dodging with practiced grace. The midday sun would broil their flesh were the pit not in the penumbra of the broken, yet nonetheless imposing, tower. The soldiers seems to keep their exertions brief. Training for but a few minutes before stopping to rest as they begin to perspire. A child walks among them dispensing small measures of water.*

		*The Proving Grounds naturally lead into what seems to be the central space of the Fortress complex, this a large courtyard through which soldiers come and go. At the edge of the courtyard is a tremendous, black iron gate, which is in turn dwarfed by the unfathomably large bulwark in which it is embedded.
		
		However, looking away from the courtyard reveals an area that looks to be an amphitheater of some kind. Beside it, a massive dome sits beneath the end of the Tacribian aqueduct, drier than the desert sand surrounding it.*

		*Eidos stands in the proving grounds of the Dawn Fortress. The sounds of bodies striking the sand and grunts of exertion ring loudly from the pit itself. But from the sidelines, the eyes of many exhausted warriors lock upon her with glowers of suspicion. Yet these are quickly distracted when the water bearers finally reach them - not even their battle-hardened faces are capable of masking their dire thirst.*

		*The battle has taken its toll on Eidos. Having exerted her Falseflesh far beyond its limits, she drops to her knees, breath quickening until she loses all control. Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

		*Approaching the Tacribian side of Heaven's Bridge, Eidos sees the shattered stump of a structure that at one time must have cast a great shadow. In bygone eras, it was surely the Moon Tower's mirror image, but now all that remains is but a miserable vestige of a broken twin. While the blackened and melted form is at present but a lowly ruin, gleaming flecks sparkling in the midday sunlight reveal the golden luster it once bore.*

However, beyond this humble keep is a defensive fortification dwarfing the walls of the other Kaban settlements by several orders of magnitude.

		*Finally entering the keep proper, Eidos notices the Tacribian warriors eyeing her with dispassionate gazes, most seeming somewhat dismissive of her presence. They make no attempt to bar her entry.
		
		The stonework all around is competently cut and mortared, albeit rough and worn. The passage through the keep here is narrow - a final choking point before stepping out onto the bridge. It looks as though there is but one way forward, yet the curving path prevents her from viewing its destination.*

		*Eidos sees that human hands have bedecked the tower’s charred corpse with bizarre ornamentation. Spear points, arrow heads and knives have been driven into cracks in its blackened surface. Small alcoves have been hollowed out and filled with inelegantly carved objects, cups and plates.
		
		Walking around the base, Eidos sees that there is an obscure shrine of some sort: a stone effigy of a vaguely feminine form clasping a jade sword. Standing in front of the shrine is an elderly woman, her gaze expectantly locked on Eidos.*

		*The conversation at its terminus Eidos scans her surroundings once more; however, her vision is thwarted from all sides by the high walls of this narrow pathway. Gazing up at the ruined tower, she sees a mixture of faces returning her stares. The Tacribian guards look upon her with stony expressions, while the carved figures placed in the broken structure bear looks of a mixture of ecstasy, terror, pain and contentment. 
		
		What is clear is that there is nowhere to go but forward into the fortress complex and no one to speak with besides the elderly Minah.*

This miserable vestige of the past is all that remains of a structure that must have cast a great shadow over the bridge at one time.

Springing into action, they surround her and mere moments later, the mage appears to exact Tacribian justice upon the intruder.*

		*Assala leads Eidos over the bridge, dashing past the ruined tower and through the narrow passage and high walls of the Keep. When the soldiers standing guard at the cusp recognize her, Assala tells of Ark's return. Several soldiers drop to their knees, prostrating themselves before Eidos, as the Valvorthr Assala had done. Others eye Eidos with great suspicion and equal measures of skepticism. Before long, one soldier runs off to alert the mage. Eidos and Assala then follow, walking briskly through the narrow confines of the Keep's pathway and into the settlement.*

Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

TEMPLE

		||
		*Walking within the stone structure, Eidos is met with a vision that defies all expectations. While the exterior was a rough brown stone, the interior is lined with white limestone and brilliant marble. Several paths lead from as many doors toward a central hub, like spokes on a cart wheel. The voids between them expose the sloping floors beneath and reveals a recession into an infinitely deep spiral consumed by shadows at its depths. The dome in which she stands seems to be but the uppermost part of this inexplicable structure.
		
		All is lit by a large aperture in the top of the dome. The rays of sunlight showering down upon the room are refracted and scattered through numerous prisms, lighting the interior with a gentle glow. A bit of sun, however, is discourteously obstructed by the terminus of the Tacribian aqueduct - dry now, but Eidos can nearly envision water cascading down from it.*

		*Grandiose though the temple may be, it looks to be unfinished and unused. There are no decorations to speak of and seemingly no paraphernalia of worship, save one. Sitting upon a large raised platform in the middle of the room is a solitary stone chair, serving as the room’s sole furnishing. But furniture is not the only scarce resource in the room; likewise, as far as Eidos can tell, not even a single human shadow haunts the temple.*

		*Walking around the perimeter of the central hub, Eidos notices there is a simple, but lengthy font of exceptional depth and a lone cleric lying prostrate before it in the utter silence of stillness. The font appears to have once been full of water, but is now so dry it would make the Wastes jealous.*

Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*

		*Ascending the stairway, Eidos alights atop the high walls of the Dawn Fortress. Looking out from the ramparts, the deathly visage of the Wasteland sears itself into her mind. The immediate area is unrelentingly bleak, with drifting dunes and blowing sand the dominant sights. However, the distant horizon makes no promises of what lies at its edge; it even seems to be fading from view, from memory, and even from the very fabric of reality.*

		*With a subtle shiver and a shake of her head, Eidos breaks the enthralling influence of the Wastes. Looking about, she notices that she is not alone here. An armed woman stands a short way off, her gaze spellbound to that uninviting expanse of land stretched out before them. However, her eyes are brimming with tragic purpose; they refuse to alter their course and will only ever be directed toward the northeast.
		
		Eidos turns her gaze to where this warrior's eyes fall. There, pearly pillars jut from the sands like a thousand skeletal fingers clawing through their burial mounds.*

		*But Eidos soon brings her attention back to the woman herself. Hardened by sights unmentionable, tested by trials unbearable, yet retaining an unmistakable grace in spite of this. Eidos' eyes leave the foreground and sharpen their focus of what lies beyond the Wasteland-obsessed warrior: a passage of stairs toward the southern end of the wall leads down into the fortress wall itself.*

But not all has abandoned Eidos upon these walls, as the familiar passage of stairs toward the southern end of the wall leading to the Archives remains accessible.*

The irreverent winds, however, loudly howl at the fortress gates, while the sun roasts the horizon, and in between them, the sands shift peacefully from dune to wretched dune in the grip of lifelessness. The Tacribian warrior seems to be attracted and bound to the inimical Wastes by some unseen and irresistible force, surely more so than sanity would ever permit.*

Far off to the east is a structure leading down into a valley of some sort. To the southeast a shining black crater belches mephitic fumes. And scanning back toward the northeast she sees a forest of symmetrically arranged pillars of the whitest salt.*

		*Before Fwayya can succumb to her injuries, a look of proud determination falls upon a point behind Eidos.

		*The battle has taken its toll on Eidos. Having exerted her Falseflesh far beyond its limits, she drops to her knees, breath quickening until she loses all control. Guards pour in, several fearlessly stepping forward to restrain her. They soon realize, however, that her own body has already done them this favor. Now cruelly acting as ally to her enemies, her stiff muscles petrify her into a pitiful facsimile of a statue. Eidos can only watch helplessly while they bind her hands and feet as they would a hog.*
