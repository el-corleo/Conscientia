		*Rikos and the courier board the tram.
        
        On the tram home to Dazil, he sees the Jenowin Plain is a lush, beautiful meadow filled with life (unlike in the Book of Eidos). This feels somehow strange in its familiarity. He feels as though he has seen it through the eyes of another, before it was a beautiful meadow, or after, he cannot recall which.
		
		See Dazil and its three-tiered structure. Arrive at the gates.*
