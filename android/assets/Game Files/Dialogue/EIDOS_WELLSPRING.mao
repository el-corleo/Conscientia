BRIDGE
	[/KABU!WELLSPRING!BRIDGE!0.000!DESCRIPTION!]

		*Walking from the corridor, Eidos steps out into a vast fracture in the earth. Huge rock formations tower overhead, and beyond them is a star-studded sky. While cold winds blow all about, the dominant sound is that of water coursing across stone.
		
		Directly across the ravine is another cliff face, some hundred paces away. A massive stone bridge connects the distant sides; built of large and roughly hewn granite stones, it is a thing of no great beauty. However, it seems sturdy and well-maintained, if nothing else.*

		*As she nears the midpoint, Eidos looks down and sees the likely source of the water's sound. Several great currents appear to flow mightily beneath this bridge through three covered channels. Yet she hears activity from only two; the third, the leftmost, is oddly silent, no water coursing through its lonesome ducts. Far below, an enormous and unmoving body of water appears to have once fed the silent channel.*

		*The howling winds turn to inaudible whimpers as Eidos enters a narrow corridor. Lichen crawling across the stonework belies the apparent age and relative disuse of this area. She slips at closely spaced intervals, stubbornly refusing to fall in spite of the slick lichen's best efforts. Before long, however, dust begins to coat the floor in thin films, making the path slightly less treacherous. While the corridor is dark at first, the promise of light shines from a door some fifty paces beyond.*

		*The threshold transports her into a dimly lit chamber. Sconces embedded in the walls bathe the room in soft, amber light, revealing finely carved support structures. The fluted columns and scrollwork adorning the structures have been aged by the persistence of the damp winds, the same ones silently creeping down the corridor in pursuit of Eidos.

		The room is dominated by a mechanical device, an open cage on a raised platform at the center of the room. Not far from where she stands, Eidos likewise spies a raised font, or stone pedestal of some sort.*

		*As Eidos approaches the cage, a visual distortion warps the space within. The air shimmers and swirls, coalescing into a pale, blue humanoid form. Balled up and floating mid air, it spins, limbs unfolding and eyelids opening, revealing a pair of glowing eyes - as amber as the crystalline light within the room - peeking out from beneath a crimson hood.*

She listens, carefully, seeking the pattern within the melody. She hears no words, only humming and buzzing, waves of emotion both consistent and evolving.
		
		Parsing the signs and signifiers, Eidos suddenly has a flash of insight: the creature does not speak; it simply emotes; and it appears to eagerly anticipate Eidos' approach...*

Soon thereafter, from within her mind, Eidos hears a faint voice echoing words in an incomprehensible tongue of buzzes and hums.
		
		Pulling the crystal from its housing, she prompts matching halos of yellow light to burst from both the floating woman's form and the shard held in Eidos' grip. The air crackles with energy and the buzzing voice inside her head becomes a high-pitched shriek, reverberating at the same frequency as the cry emanating from the heart of the crystal itself.*

		The Glyph of Fenrir and its Techne of Extraction resonate as the woman's brow emits a wave of desperate, yellow light. The crystal responds to the Glyph-Techne dyad and its energetic pattern merges with Eidos, the anguished creature dissipating as its essence feeds Eidos.*

		Riding atop a shower of angry stones, Eidos falls into the chamber below. Precious air, now corrupted with dust, returns to her lungs as she tumbles in gravity's embrace.*

		*Walking into the passage, Eidos feels the full oppression of the cold and damp. Droplets of moisture sprinkle down upon her head as she makes her way toward the faint, flickering light up ahead. Stumbling over the uneven and obscured paving stones, she nears the source of illumination only to discover its grim source: a human skull placed into a hollow in the stone wall. A single shard of crystalline glass has been placed within the left eye-socket, and it burns with a perpetual yet undulating light.
		
		From here, she sees the path taking a sharp turn, leading toward another grisly light cyclops. Passing three such lanterns, dozens of paces separating one from the next, she finally arrives at a larger space, brilliantly illuminated with a powerful array of crystals...*

		*In this room, Eidos looks upon the resting place of countless dead. The limestone chamber is simply carved, scores of alcoves lining both sides, each filled with bones. She notes that the remains are sorted according to kind - whether they be rib, limb, digit or spine. The skulls are venerated above all else, each placed within its own small hollow; each gifted with a shard of shining crystal as a left eye.*

		*As she walks forward, it becomes clear that this chamber is larger than it at first appeared. Further wings extend from all sides; yet only two of these are of any note. The first, directly ahead, is a separate room, illuminated by a different species of light, pale white in color; the other is to the side and is significantly dimmed; all others are obstructed by mounds of excavated rock and the tools that moved them.
		
		Peeking into the near lightless wing, the recent excavation adequately explains its dim state; skull-lamps having been displaced and scattered throughout a lengthy tunnel, carved deep into the bedrock. Pickaxes and shovels litter the ground, while some human remains have been rather unceremoniously moved to wooden bins. Turning her attention to the pale room, all she can make out are the outlines of two bulky statues flanking either side of a doorway further into darkness.*

The two figures stand opposite one another as though peering at their own reflections. Within the illusory mirror, identical women dressed for war, each nearly twice as tall as Eidos, lock eyes in front of an unobstructed doorway. Both have a hand resting upon the pommel of their giant swords, while the other is raised toward Eidos, palm facing outwards. They wear expressionless faces, making it impossible to tell if these are gestures of salutation, intimidation, or caution.*

		*In a sudden burst of motion, the marble warriors bring their lustrous swords down, converging upon Eidos. The instant before impact, Eidos can feel her skin harden as Luin responds to her mortal danger. The heavy swords send sparks flying as they scrape down her shielded Falseflesh. But the pressure is too great, the force too energetic, and she is violently ejected from the room...*

There they remain, calm and unmoving, as though the threat they initially perceived had simply vanished.*

From falling
	[/KABU!WELLSPRING!DEEP LAKE!0.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*The air is forced from her lungs as Eidos slams into a subterranean lake. Plunged into its murky depths, she thrashes about violently, limbs clawing through the dark water, desperately searching for the surface. Just as hopelessness begins to corrupt her resolve, a hand suddenly pierces into her watery prison, clutching her arm in its steely grip.*

		||
		*An inhuman exertion extricates her from the cold confines of the water and onto the edge of a small wooden raft. Eidos gracelessly heaves herself over the side with the aid of her strange benefactor. She rolls to her side, soaked to the bone and gurgling. Hacking, heaving, she tries to expel all uninvited liquid from her lungs. When she can finally breathe anew, she simply lies gasping on the floor of the rickety craft as the figure of her rescuer looms above. Though his face is obscured by the shadows cloaking this underground lake, Eidos can see his scrawny form is covered in little but rags and tatters.*

		*With the speed of an attacking serpent, his hand reaches out to grip Eidos' mouth. The same steely grip that saved her from the water now threatens to crush her skull to powder. Soon she feels threads of thought weaving together within the mind of the figure crouched over her; he summons a Glyph...*

		*In an instant, a burning sensation races through her blood. Just as she is seized with a sudden rush of nausea, the hand of her rescuer jerks her head violently to the side in time for Eidos to vomit off into the subterranean lake. Her stomach now empty, the vice-like grip releases her, and for a time, all Eidos can hear is the sound of the craft gently rocking.*

		*Quangjo turns and takes up a nearby oar. He dips it into the still surface of the lake and begins to paddle, slowly and deliberately. Sitting up, Eidos sees that the craft is crudely fashioned, its flat bottom hastily lashed together with fraying rope and rusting nails. The raft creaks softly as it slowly lurches towards a curtain of shadows untouched by the starlight above.

        Soon they are bathed in complete darkness, as the vessel glides beneath a stone overhang. At this, Quangjo abruptly halts his paddling, allowing the boat to coast. Eidos cannot make out his shape, but from his absolute silence, he likely stands unmoving, still as death. Simply waiting...*

		*An indeterminate span of time passes before he can be heard manipulating a metallic object at the bow. Suddenly, the darkness around is banished by a pale light. Eidos recognizes the makeshift lantern as similar to the sconces she saw where she first awakened. Quangjo then suspends the lantern from a short post and begins driving the boat deeper into the caves, gripping the nearby rockface to do so.*

		*Before long, light can be seen faintly reflecting off of a metal surface in the distance. After a time, the object reveals itself to be a gargantuan door, the stone wall surrounding it appearing to be some sort of super structure carved from a single, unbroken megalith. This impossible barrier shares no similarities with the natural rocks forming this underground cavern, though it seamlessly dovetails with every erratic curve and jagged edge presented to it.*

		*The sound of Quangjo's oar hitting the water steals her attention away from the gate. The craft smoothly veers left, towards a nearby stone platform. When the boat thuds into the platform's edge, Quangjo leaps out and secures the craft with a moldy length of rope; he simply wipes the organic residue off his hands and onto his already filthy clothes. He reaches for the lantern from the prow with one hand and a metal pail full of fish - some rotting, some freshly caught - in the other. He then motions with an awkward nod of his head for Eidos to follow before cautiously skulking off into the darkness.*

		*Stepping onto the makeshift dock, Eidos follows Quangjo towards a low, arching door. All along the way she dodges giant bookcases, chaotically toppled by some long-forgotten cataclysm, and the rotten tomes they spewed as they collapsed. The ground is slick with mildew and algae, forcing Eidos to grip the fallen giants around her for a modicum of extra support. More than a few turn to a pulpy mush under her weight, yet she makes it through unscathed and without slipping.*

Soon, Eidos focuses on the mischievous sounds that seek to disturb the peace. Their footsteps. Quangjo's labored breathing. The echo of water trickling on stone all about...*

		*Eidos leaps down onto the landing, crushing the damp vegetation beneath her weight. The innocent flora is not without recourse, however, for the destructive pressure wrings all moisture from the plants, propelling Eidosâ€™ feet in random directions. The result, naturally, is an intimate encounter with the rocky ground.
		
		Fallen, she sits, pain crawling up her tender rump through her spine and showering out across her entire body in intense sparks of agony. Whatever the consequences of her descent, she has the last laugh as she rises, injured but unbroken, triumphant in arriving at her desired destination. She leaves the question as to whether or not it was worth it for later consideration.*

		*Eidos then surveys the surroundings. She now stands a story or two above the edge of a great underground lake. Out on the dark water, she hears the sounds of an invisible oar furtively paddling - though the darkness has consumed any visual vestige of its operator.
		
		Straight ahead, a massive dam rises from the lake, barring passage to the water that impatiently laps up against it. At the rightmost extreme of the dam, a warm amber glow hints at a crystal. To the left, a path extends downward, hugging the cliff face as it leads to a great archway near the opposite end of the bridge.*

The walls are lined with slippery co-conspirators, seeking to block any and all attempts Eidos might make to scale the damp walls. She is utterly thwarted and has no choice but to return.*

		*Eidos awkwardly rushes back to the platform whence she disembarked, slipping several times on the way. She hurriedly unties the moldy rope attaching the raft to the dock and hops onto the swaying watercraft. Then, placing both feet on the dock's stone, she kicks off with a mighty effort, coasting off into the dark. She soon finds herself adrift on the flimsy craft, with no means to steer it. Her hands feel blindly for the oar she thinks should be there, yet finds nothing. In total darkness, she searches from edge to edge, and yet still fails to find it.*

		*Soon, the craft emerges into the starlight of the ravine, drawn by an invisible current. The dim light is as day is to night for her eyes and she now sees clearly what her hands had told her already: there is no oar. It might have fallen off when she kicked off from the dock or perhaps it was not there to begin with. Whatever the case may be, this did not change the fact that she was now at the lake's mercy. Though thankfully, the raft did at least appear to be moving away from her point of departure.*

		*Countless indistinguishable rockfaces pass her by, sheer walls, precipitous overhangs and absolutely nothing she could scale. But as she rounds a bend, she observes a distinctly unnatural feature, stopping up the water as best it can. A dam. A giant megalith wedged between two similarly artificial ledges, one of which emanates an amber glow from some obviously crystalline source. A minimal fissure seems to mar the surface of the dam, admitting a small flow of water to leak through. But more importantly, for better or for worse, the gentle current she rode this far seems to have been guiding her directly towards this barrier...*

		*As she nears the dam, a visual distortion warps the space before it. The air shimmers and swirls, coalescing into a pale blue humanoid form. Balled up and floating mid air, it spins, limbs unfolding and eyelids opening. A pair of glowing, yellow eyes peek out from beneath a crimson hood. The elegant and terrifying form of an all but naked woman now hovers before Eidos, suspended in the air as if in water. The tendrils of her long, red hair snake and writhe about her head with uncanny slowness; what appeared to be a hood atop her head, Eidos now sees as merely an extension of the creature's prehensile hair.*

		*With no warning, the woman begins to brighten, light illuminating her entire form from within, ever-intensifying, until, at its luminous zenith, it violently explodes, sending shock waves rippling off in the six directions. A wave of water races towards Eidos and her stolen raft, fueled by the energy of the blast. As it crashes down upon them, the craft is rent apart and Eidos swept from its deck. Other effects of the explosion linger, their consequences less immediate. For one, the small crack in the dam now snakes violently up towards the top of the ruined structure. It is only a matter of time before it shatters completely under the immense pressure of the water...*

Large fragments of stone sink into the lake as the wall disintegrates, releasing the water's pent up fury it once suppressed. Eidos' eyes widen in horror as the gentle current turns into an inescapable torrent sweeping her along into a darkened channel stretched out before her.*

		*A winding spiral of stairs are bathed in a thin layer of water, causing each step Eidos takes to squish and splash; yet it is thin enough not to affect her grip on the stone beneath.

		*Eidos feels grateful at least that she need not proceed in darkness - as is so often the case. The illumination of this staircase appears to originate from distantly-spaced crystalline lanterns, all glowing with a subdued, pale light as they dangle from high above. The ceiling itself hides among the shadows, the meager lantern light incapable of banishing any real darkness beyond a ten-pace radius. In truth, the warm lantern rays can only ever dam up the creeping murk and delay its inevitable annihilation of luminosity. The dam always succumbs to entropy.*

This then leaves Eidos with three paths from this area. One is the continuation of the stairway descending further into the earth, while another winds its way upward. Finally, there is this narrow crack in the rock wall.*

		*No more than twenty paces in, the tunnel widens into an irregularly shaped chamber, bulging here and narrowing there, but never less than fifty paces wide. Nets line the ceiling to catch larger pieces of rubble before someone's head would have broken their fall. Crates and shelves, scattered tools and oddly even a desk, account for most of the contents of the room, though its other holdings are certainly more interesting.
		
		A number of statues have been left in alcoves that combine avian and human features. Other areas hold fragments of darkened glasses, or perhaps crystal, of various shapes and sizes.
		
		The wooden desk in the center of the room appears to have been hauled from elsewhere - no mean feat, given its awkward dimensions and hefty look. Upon it are parchments newly written, made legible by a skull left nearby, its flameless yet burning eye casting long shadows across the room.*

		*Darkness flees with the advent of light. Pure, concentrated, nary a flicker as it rushes out from the Farcaster seal. The process inverts. Bones and sinew weave a shell, and skin rushes to complete her Falseflesh as Eidos is rebuilt from the life-fire of the Nether Edge. When the reintegration ends and the light dies, the murky shadows return and Eidos is plunged into their dark realm. She is immediately buffeted from all sides by short-lived gusts of wind, driving her from the metallic surface of the Farcaster seal. Her eyes grow accustomed to the chamberâ€™s low light. Four walls shield half an octagonal chamber, the missing ones the source of the recent gales.
		
		Moving forward towards the opening and looking down, she sees tiny pinpoints of light, shimmering within the tenebrous surface below. They stare at her like the myriad eyes of curious yet shy onlookers hiding behind dark veils. Yet soon the illusion is dispelled. As Eidos notices their unnatural swaying motion, she sees the reflection for what it is. These are the light of the stars mischievously misguiding their observers into a reflecting pool. Canting her head skywards, she confirms her suspicions, finding a band of sky snaking through the canopy of shadows overhead.*

The tiles here may be cracked and broken all about, and the walls may be barren and devoid of all decoration, but the material, and structure are identical to what she witnessed in the Sanctuary.
		
		Staring out beyond the missing walls, Eidos soon sees that this room is not the only victim of entropyâ€™s greed; in fact, the building housing the chamber itself has likewise been ripped open by some ancient cataclysm. An immense ravine cuts through the building like a killing blow from Heavenâ€™s sword.
		
		Behind her, a door but ten paces away breaks the continuity of the walls and leads deeper into the Wellspring.*

An expansive area, the room features a ring of rough-hewn stones, engraved with crude shapes and symbols. Into each stone is driven an iron nail, and to each nail is fastened a pitted iron chain.

		Errant streams of subdued light give the three doors of this room an icy glow. The lack of lighting within the chamber, however, forces her eyes to grow attuned to the shadows. What the darkness once concealed is a living area in complete disarray. Bedding, chairs, tables, bunks and tomes have been scattered across the floor. Walking becomes difficult as a great number of the bunks themselves have been ripped from the walls and splintered into puzzles impossible to reassemble.*

		*As the cage travels further up the shaft, the darkness slowly gives way to a dim yet variegated glow. When the contraption is pulled passed the lip of the floor above, Eidos witnesses its source. Innumerable crystalline pieces adorn the walls, each one glowing dimly like an everlasting candle flame.
		
		The illumination distracts, however, from the true nature of this rainbow mosaic; crystals upon three of the four walls are arranged in what looks to be a collection of smaller images, seeming to relate a series of grand events. While the character and detail of the happenings differs, they appear to have been committed to stone at the same time and by a single artist. The stark contrast of the one wall standing completely devoid of glass and light seems to await a history yet to come.*

		*The first wall shows a number of folk standing in worship about a circle of stones at whose center is a massive tree. The branches of this great white Muninn host leaves of a vibrant emerald green. Looking closely, Eidos sees that this wall is framed in a matching border of twisting, leafy vines. A blue clad figure sits in its branches, bearing a halo or sun-like object in upraised hands.
		
		Another image upon the wall depicts three individuals following a gray-hooded figure into a range of mountains. They are followed by two hulking beasts a story tall and twice as long, skinned in plates of shimmering sapphire.
		
		The final image on this wall depicts the gray leader and his fellows lying dead, while the image of the blue clad figure stands triumphant. His followers and the armored beasts are drawn in poses of worship and submission before their vanquisher.*

		*The second wall's first image shows a proud woman displaying a vibrant emerald spear with many people knelt before her, hands widespread in stances of adoration and awe. The blade of the weapon shines brightly, reflecting off of several skulls and bones littered across the ground.
		
		The same individual is shown atop a mountain in battle with one of the hulking, sapphire beasts from the first mural. The result of the combat is clear, with the emerald blade drawing rubies from the beast's defeated husk.
		
		In the final vignette, gouts of yellow smoke seem to belch forth from its mouth, striking many bystanders dead while the heroine's fate remains ambiguous. However, the leaves of the border look to have withered to a barely luminescent imperial topaz.*

		*The third wall continues the heroineâ€™s saga. She is locked in combat with a monstrous thing, painted as a horrific fusion of human and animal features, with pale diamond skin bathed in onyx flame. It seems that in response to this struggle, the vines that make up the border are being consumed by the dark fire radiating from the abomination.
		
		Wreathed around this scene is a larger conflict between armed warriors and a horde of emaciated horrors, looking more skeletal than human. Everything is illustrated in brutal detail with all the visceral imagery of war. A gold flecked tower is drawn in a state of collapse, falling into a canyon. Nearby, obsidian wolves and crows feast upon the corpses of the dead. It seems as though the female champion and her nemesis follow the golden tower, all of them falling into a pitch abyss at the bottom of a canyon, just below a leviathanic bridge.
		
		However, the final image upon the wall depicts both the heroine and the monster still alive. The lower third of the image shows the adversary in a chamber deep beneath the earth, superimposed over a black void, chained and imprisoned. The heroine is shown with her weapon over her shoulder, walking into a desert that fades into the face of the barren stone wall.*

		Her eyes, now fully adjusted to the lonely starlight above, spot the reflective surface of another rockface at the far side of this expansive ravine. Though too dark to tell for sure, she thinks she spots four more walls on the opposite side.
		
		Suddenly, Eidos feels an unfamiliar presence. Engraved into a smooth stone pedestal near her, a Glyph stares up at the starlit sky. However, she does not recognize the symbol - though perhaps at one time she did, it remains difficult to pin down memories of a foreign past.*

		A single tear for Rikharr traces his cheek, falling to the cold metal of his throne. The deep spring beneath these ruins cries in sympathy, thus beginning the endless flow now within the Wellspring. The flame of life soon flares within the ancient edifice as the mage's own flame slowly dwindles, slowly wanes, soon becoming nothing but a thin stream of smoke.

Her sight is utterly devastated by the shadowy environs, and her sense of smell overwhelmed by a particularly pungent odor. Nose and throat snort and groan, dry with caked grit and dust, as though drowning in the sands of the Kaban Wastes. Even her footing is unsure as the floor here seems to be cracked stone covered by layers of silt. Her foot falls send muffled echoes as if she were hearing them through water, making it difficult to determine the dimensions of the space she so blindly traverses.*

Suddenly, she feels a stabbing sensation within the pit of her stomach. A feeling of supreme nausea overcomes her. Her head and the chalice collapse upon the table with a crack and a clang. Eyes close. In her mind's eye, she sees her organs breaking apart and dissolving. Tears of blood streak burning ruts down her cheeks. When she finally attempts to open her eyes, she realizes there are no longer any within her melting skull. And it is into nothingness she descends. Her ghost, sensing the imminent demise of this Falseflesh vacates and looks for its next shell...*

		*This place was evidently a library at some point. Tomes line the shelves of all bookcases that have not yet collapsed, and by the rotten, moldy smell that pervades, even these shelves have been eaten away by the dampness all around. Even more tomes are strewn about the wet floor, vomited forth from crippled piles of wooden debris.
		
		The only path unimpeded is a narrow stretch leading to separate islands in the sea of volumes and folios. A large table, a reading chair and a pathetic looking bedroll seem to indicate this is Quangjo's makeshift residence.*

		*There appears to be another exit further down, but the darkness lies too thick there to see where it might lead. Soon the shadows begin to dance as the light sways and shifts, Quangjo has gracelessly suspended his light from a poorly crafted wooden frame. He sets down the bucket of fish with a clang and eases his thin frame down into his chair, motioning for Eidos to approach.
		
		As she does, she observes that in addition to the bucket, the table is set with a metallic carafe, studded with gems. Scraps of half eaten fish, bones and papers dotted with dried blood litter the surface of the table, providing continuity with the chaos strewn about the floor. Quangjo then draws a fish from the bucket and plops it down on the table. Now in its death throes, the creature stares back at them, terror filling it milky eyes.*

Then, placing the fish aside, he grips the carafe with both hands and bows his head. Eidos begins to perceive a familiar sensation as Quangjo calls to mind a Glyph. The gems studding the jar spring to life briefly, resonating with Librarians invocation.

		*Five corners mark where the walls' edges meet. The walls seem reflections of the floor, extending upwards like the petals of a metallic rose in bloom. The ceiling is but another reflection of the floor and walls, though shifted in phase and angle. All sides of this chamber bear radiant crystalline structures, each of which pulsates rhythmically like the beating of an elemental heart.
		
		The composition of the walls is difficult to determine, their reflective but harsh sheen looking like a strange fusion of mineral and metal. On the floor, Eidos sees countless silvered lines etched within this material. They run in cascades of parallel lines, dividing, flowing and rejoining at harsh angles, birthing from them the skeleton of a massive Glyph...*

		*The dizzying sight of this unfinished Glyph appears to frame what should have been the most salient element of the room; Eidos sees lying prone within the confines of the lines a hulking mound. Thrice as tall as the observer in height and width, yet more than double that in depth, the beast towers over Eidos even when lying down. Its surface is composed of interlocking metallic plates, their cobalt sheen broken by seams that shift in color between a dim gray and a brilliantly luminescent yellow. The change in hue occurs in slow pulses in time with the pulse of the surrounding wall crystals.*

		*Then, slowly but steadily, the metallic behemoth begins to move. With a sibilant sound as if steel ground on a whetstone, the plates unfold and separate from each other. The form of an immense quadrupedal monstrosity unfurls. Standing more than four times her height, it ponderously turns its massive head toward Eidos, a furious intellect apparent in its unerring gaze.
		
		Soon, a seam slowly reveals itself in the smooth surface of its face as it unhinges a gaping jaw - its maw filled with cruel teeth jutting from metallic lips, all of a single, unbroken piece. Rising from its reclined position and with grace defying its bulk, it marches towards Eidos...*

		*The monster collapses, cerulean ichor oozing from its wounds. With this beast slain, the power in the Wellspring is extinguished; water ceases to well up from the ground and the flow of water through its aqueducts is stemmed. Now it is no longer just Tacribians who thirst, but rather the entirety of the Kaban region. With the end of water comes the end of Kabu...*

		*The realization hits Eidos and she falls to her knees. The game is over, the play has finished, and she has left her indelible mark on the world. Yet, in that moment, Eidos senses the very last unfractured crystal embedded within the beast calls out to her, the mental defenses of her adversary laid bare before her. A plea for memory. A desire to not be dealt the final death of forgetting...
		
		For a brief instant, she feels a hunger within her mind. As though awakened by the smell of blood, Eidos can sense the ravening jaws of Fenrir.*

		*Five corners mark where the walls' edges meet. The walls seem reflections of the floor, extending upwards like the petals of a metallic rose in bloom. The ceiling is but another reflection of the floor and walls, though shifted in phase and angle. All sides of this chamber bear radiant crystalline structures, each of which pulsates rhythmically like the beating of an elemental heart.
		
		The composition of the walls is difficult to determine, their reflective but harsh sheen looking like a strange fusion of mineral and metal. Moreover, looking down at the floor, Eidos sees countless silvered lines etched within this material. They run in cascades of parallel lines, dividing, flowing and rejoining at harsh angles, birthing from them the skeleton of a massive Glyph...*

		*The dizzying sight of this unfinished Glyph appears to frame what should have been the most salient element of the room; Eidos sees lying prone within the confines of the lines a hulking mound. Thrice as tall as the observer in height and width, yet more than double that in depth, the beast towers over Eidos even when lying down. Its surface is composed of interlocking metallic plates, their cobalt sheen broken by seams that shift in color between a dim gray and a brilliantly luminescent yellow. The change in hue occurs in slow pulses in time with the pulse of the surrounding wall crystals.*

		*Then, slowly but steadily, the metallic behemoth begins to move. With a sibilant sound as if steel ground on a whetstone, the plates unfold and separate from each other. The form of an immense quadrupedal monstrosity unfurls. Standing more than four times her height, it ponderously turns its massive head toward Eidos, a furious intellect apparent in its unerring gaze.
		
		Soon, a seam slowly reveals itself in the smooth surface of its face as it unhinges a gaping jaw - a maw filled with cruel teeth jutting from its metallic lip, all of a single, unbroken piece. Rising from its reclined position and with grace defying its bulk, it marches towards Eidos...
		
		Yet, the frail Librarian seems utterly unaffected. His habitually watery eyes simply stare ahead as he walks resolutely towards a dark glass panel nearby.*

She now stands in a chamber built up of a great many walls rising around her in the shape of an irregular orb. Each wall appears to be a five-sided surface, though thick clouds of incense smoke make their exact number difficult to determine.

Only the slightest hint of red abides within them to hint at their dying embers. They surround a great mass at the chamber's center, a heap of material indistinct in the gloom. Traced white chalk patterns adorn the floor, as they did in the Silver Shrine whence she came, yet the relative lack of luminescence renders them dull and lifeless by comparison.*

		*He had lied to people countless times before, deceived them into a false sense of kinship. In truth, Wulfias' intent with Rikharr was no different... initially, at least. But eventually, he came to realize that he trusted the Kaban. Trust. An emotion a slave can ill afford. Yet, even as the Masters ruthlessly experimented upon Wulfias, Rikharr did all he could to help him learn, to teach him.*

		*Light appears to be in short supply. What little aid Eidos' strained eyes do receive bleeds in from large gashes in the domed ceiling far above. However, those exposed patches of starlight burned in the midnight sky rain down enough of their bounty to make out the shapes and sizes of all objects within the chamber. While the stars were myriad fireflies in the great abyss of the Ravine, here their power is blurred, distorted, and yet unified. Their ambient glow seems to coalesce around a shining silver throne, as though it wore a shroud woven from spiraling flecks of mist and light.*

		*This room is a strange concoction of ruin and ritual, accident and artifice. The floor gently crackles with her every step as though eggshells lined her path. Looking down, Eidos notes that the floor was once made of titanic slabs of stone, each perhaps twice as wide as she is tall and half again as long, yet all are now shattered. Cracks spread out like spiderwebs from focused wounds in the slabs.
		
		Gaze again shifting skywards, Eidos observes that the many dark panes of the ceiling mirror the ground in their destruction. Nearly all are marred by countless fractures streaking across their surfaces like sparks frozen in time.*

		*Yet, the room's utter ruin stands in stark opposition to its centerpiece. The metallic throne abates the encroaching pandemonium, a defiant rock standing amid the crashing waves of entropy. It is surrounded by clay vessels of water, eight in number. From these eight points, white chalk radiates outward, marking a spiraling pathway through the chamber. The line connects each impact point to the central throne, octagons within squares within circles surrounding each point. Unlit candles have been placed along this path and the smell of incense still lingers in the air.
		
		The perfection and symmetry given to these tracings battle Nature's tendency toward anarchy, serving as an imposition of order upon chaos, stability upon uncertainty.*

		*Eidos carefully steps across the cracking surface and over the designs, momentarily darkening the shimmering glow of reflected starlight as though she were a storm cloud blotting out the sun. The silvered throne appears to blur as she draws nearer and clarity eludes her vision despite conquering physical distance. The surface appears to have melted slightly, as if it had once been exposed to intense heat.
		
		An irresistible urge to sit upon the chair emerges, and without understanding why, she sits. All about her, a lingering whisper echoes, yet she does not feel the vibrations of a physical sound. The whisper crescendos through the power of mechanisms unseen until language emerges.*

To the right, a nearly identical gate resides. This twin is of similar composition, but unlike its candid brother, this gate is sealed shut.*

The room's center is occupied by a raised altar of some sort, with bowls of offering placed upon it.
		
		Most notable of all, perhaps, are the two statues flanking the altar. They look to be crafted from wood, and clothed in dark raiments. Their form is a hybrid of human shape and avian features. Their feet are clawed with red-accented, ivory talons, and their elongated faces, though veiled in scarves, provide the impression of beaks.*

Ten paces in, all shadows are exiled to the realm of memory as countless lights in the floor and ceiling spring to life. The reflective black dome above her, the walls of dark granite, the intricately carved designs in a lattice of forbidden geometries, all of these reveal themselves to her light-shocked eyes.*

		*But before long, the spell is broken and she regains her bearings. Examining the dome, she focuses on the large panes of black glass filling in the spaces between the stonework, all trimmed and gilded in a silvery metal. They share a strong resemblance to the ones she encountered in the Sanctuary.
		
		At the opposite end of the chamber, an enormous and robust door blocks passage with its overlapping metallic scales. The dominant feature of the chamber, however, is the high-backed, silver throne that appears to grow right out of the floor's center.*

		After she completes her round,Eidos sits upon the throne. To her right, a small stone column rises from the floor. It is lined and laced with strands of liquid silver.
		
		Then, the emanation of a thought pulses from the contraption. A sense of expectation fills Eidos' mind... An expectation she, unfortunately, cannot fulfill. And as such, she rises from the chair and the stone column recedes.*

It has a beauty both flamboyant and austere; just as a silver ingot may shine and sparkle, yet is still simply a hunk of metal, so too does this throne walk the line between simplicity and extravagance.
		
		After she completes her round, Eidos sits in the chair. All about her, the dark glass panels spring to life, displaying myriad scattered images, flowing one from the next. However, the panel directly in front of her remains fixed on a single image, frozen in time. This panel shows the body of water she witnessed on her way here.*

		*Eidos and Quangjo enter a pitch darkness. Here, the echoes from their footsteps clicking on the tiled floor betray the vast size of this chamber. But soon, shadows are sent into the realm of memory as countless lights in the floor and ceiling spring to life. The reflective black dome above their heads, the walls of dark granite, and intricately carved designs in a lattice of forbidden geometries all reveal themselves to their now watery eyes.*

Further, she notes that much of the environment is trimmed and gilded in a silvery metal. At the opposite end of the chamber, an enormous and robust door blocks passage with its overlapping metallic scales. However, the dominant feature of the chamber is undoubtedly the high-backed, silver throne seemingly growing right out of the floor's center.*
