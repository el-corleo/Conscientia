		*Robbed of sight as we are, blind we are not. Our ally, the deft oarsman Vovkos, heeds not the illusions of the eyes, guided instead by the wailing winds. He now listens to Nature's song, to the waves echoing off the seabed's crusty fingers. He and he alone hears the wailing warnings off those stony claws that reach out from the watery depths to drag us under, down to the destruction of the Falseflesh!*

And more than this, prophecies, nay, memories - for what are prophecies but memories of the future? - indeed, according to memories told from other lives, other journeys, it is here that we finally meet.*

		*An emphatic crack punctuates with echoing finality his last words, and our boat docks into the archaic peer. This island appears to house numerous structures from Vanquished eras, the dock among them, fashioned with a precision and cunning beyond even the treacherous Thiudans' capabilities. Seamless stones fitted together and unmoved for uncounted spans of forgotten time, as though yet awaiting their cruel masters' return. The winds and waters in alliance for centuries have failed to so much as chip the edges of these docks. Clearly the All-Seer will not allow his servants to soon forget the hubris of their sinful ancestors...*

		*But more memories of the fallen come in the form of a sweeping beam of intense light. It cuts through the very fog and illuminates the path through the craggy and perilous shore like some false Biracul! Though one misstep here would mean certain death, should we sinners not trust in the All-Seer's plan? What work of witchcraft is it that causes false light to chase fog from the very air which spawned it? Such an ominous Techne does much to make one ill-at-ease in this wretched land.*

        As if a demon summoned by the thought of its name, the wastes wheeze their foul breath at my back, kicking up spiraling clouds of dust. The spirals dance toward the open gate - unwanted guides urging on a reluctant visitor. Remembering all too well what awaits, these feet still walk those fateful steps across the threshold.*
