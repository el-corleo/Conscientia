The obstruction affords Eidos little chance of further progress down this route.

		*Emerging from the Wellspring gate, Eidos is greeted by the cool, open air of a mountainside. High peaks rise up all about, hiding the horizon beyond. Yet, the dimming of the twinkling stars in the sky heralds the searing warmth of daybreak.
		
		Stretching out below her is a road snaking its way down the slopes toward Dazir, home of the mage Khaa. Beside this path, in the gloom of the cliff overhead, is a plateau and a small encampment within. The encampment soon births an elderly man from its sole tent. Bound in a turquoise robe, he glides across the dusty path toward her, seeming to phase into existence like a jittery mirage. A wave of his hand silently signals a greeting upon seeing her, as he continues his approach...*

The mountains have an unnatural feel to them; they do not grow from gradually emerging foothills, but rather, more closely resemble stalagmites slowly deposited from above, wishing to join their heaven-mirrored twins. Behind the nearest peak, the tip of a massive work of rectilinear architecture hints at an imposing structure beyond. Extending forth from the mountain's belly are arching supports bearing aqueducts - one reaching her current location and the other crawling eastward.
		
		Eidos' eye follows this eastbound aqueduct across the horizon as it leads to a distant settlement. Whatever buildings might lie within, though, are hidden by a high wall - save the shimmering silver spire thrusting into the sky like a silent threat to the gods. The spire disseminates reflected rays across the dry plain, as though it were the very sun's earthly ambassador.*

		*Eidos scans the ruins now making up her surroundings, witnessing the remains of what once was a bustling town. Though the place appears to have lain deserted for uncounted centuries, the buildings yet stand, all but unscathed by the passage of time.
		
		One unique feature, likely the one responsible for the town's desertion, mars the central courtyard the town encircles. Jutting up from the ground like teeth in some bestial maw are thick shards of glass, wider than Eidos is tall and twice again her height. As she walks by, these jagged fangs seem to shimmer in the meager light of the environs.
		
		What light does bathe the abandoned settlement appears to come from a break in the massive stone dome that shelters the place. Though, upon closer inspection the area is far too well illuminated for this to be the case. Turning her attention to the dome itself, Eidos discovers a subtle translucence to it, its stony appearance the result of the sun's rays being scattered, refracted and otherwise disturbed.*

		*Eidos comes once more to the ruins of Tacriba. Abandoned and forgotten, it shares the fate of all who dared exist. The eldritch illumination of the false stone dome still gives a hazy impression that the city itself is but a memory. The ground still pretends to be some monstrous mouth agape in a perpetual howl, baring jagged teeth that dimly shimmer in the meager light.
		
		Nothing new here in this graveyard for memories.*

		*Staggering into the crevice half-blind from the storm, Eidos wends her way among the rocks back to the forgotten township. Stumbling between the forest of glassy shards, towards the dried up fountain in the deserted square, she casts herself to the ground in exhaustion. Covering her face, she shuts her eyes forcing herself into a healing repose.*

		*She remembers the Jenowin Plain, its sun and oppressive heat. A red patchwork cloak. She sees herself looking out over the desert. Trying to decide which way to go. Warnings of a well that spills no water. Guardians who kill their charges. Food that poisons those who consume it. She sees the scarred and thoughtless visage of the sentry. A wide-brimmed hat the color of dried blood. She is walking down the winding stairs. Now she is running. A sense of panic rushes through her as she searches in vain for the entrance to the Awakening Chamber. Raking her hands across the unmoving stone wall until her nails rip from her fingers, fountains of dark blood erupting from them. She hears a noise. She turns to see a pair of shimmering rubies watching her from the stairwell...*

She is still in the abandoned settlement of Tacriba, and realizes that she is not alone. For perched upon the edge of the dry fountain is the desert wayfarer, keeping a watchful eye on Eidos.*
