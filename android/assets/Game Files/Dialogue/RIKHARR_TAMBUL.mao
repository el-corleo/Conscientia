DYSAR MANOR

		*RADYSAR greets Rikos and congrats him on his ascension. Tells him of the news regarding the Muninn saplings. Would have involved Rikos, but he seemed to be off galavanting elsewhere. In any event, should arrive before the Festival of Light. She wishes him good fortune and a swift return from the Sun Tower. Oh, and a shame about your father, such a tragedy. But Dazil is in the good hands of his heir. If he needs advice on how to manage a township, he need but ask.
		
		PERHAPS we can see Lazham leaving the manor before entering.*
