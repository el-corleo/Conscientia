		*The Self closes its eyes and begins to meditate within the Mindscape. It perceives the full extension of its being, in a superposition between past, present and future along multiple, previously unseen, axes. In doing so, the lines between dimensions fold in upon each other, thick and viscous, layer by layer.
		
		A greater tolerance for the sublime ambiguity of existence emerged. Eyes closed, the unending recursion begins as the process will begin once more. Going deeper into the infinite sea of consciousness. Tempted by the remote possibility of enlightenment, the desire to push on and on, ever forward increased.*

		*In the space of a thought, a lifetime, a millennium, and ever-advancing orders of magnitude, the Self was lost in the fusion of time and consciousness. Yet it eventually becomes clear that there is no way through this sea of being, this deepened state of perception.
		 
		And it is thus that the Self grew weary of wandering and will simply quit. But of course the beyond was out there, further into the sea of Awareness. Somewhere. This superficial confusion gives way to a crystalline clarity. And then...*

		*The Self stands among the swaying Redgrain stalks of a windswept plain. Dense, chest-high fields cover the flat land like woolly carpets, spread out as far as the eye can see. The fields seem to meld seamlessly into a sky caught in the crimson haze of a perpetual dusk.
		
		As the Self strides forward, the sizzling sound of grain against thigh becomes a comfortable whisper, lulling it into a calmed state. Carving a path through the vermilion carpet, the Self feels as though it could spend the rest of eternity in this peaceful place...*

		*The Self stops. Darkness streams down the ruddy sky like black paint on window. Pitiful stars creep what light they can through the nightmarish heavens. While sun and moon both weakly occupy opposite corners of the sky, it is nearly impossible to tell which is master. One sphere is an ashen disk bathed in a smoldering red glow, the other, simply a lump of rust bleeding forth dull light like blood from the face of a ruined god.
		
		Tall grasses are made to bend before these dying lords as the winds heave breaths of dry air. Bearing the fruits of this crop, the wind tastes of a mixture of malt and phosphorus.*

		*The Self sees itself, separate in form but unquestionably identical in essence. It walks through these fields carving a path through the grassy, red carpet. This separate Self turns around revealing a featureless face peering back with its absent eyes before bursting into a murder of crimson crows, scattering off into the distance and dissolving into the sky.*

		*When the Self returns its attention to the plain, two landmarks manifest from the recesses of memory.
		
		One looks to be a farmstead of some sort. A grass-roofed hut sits amid the Redgrain fields, half the roof scattered by wind and broken by time. Tools of harvest recline along the broadside of a rickety animal shed nearby. While the deplorable state of the derelict house would indicate it has been long since abandoned, a light in the window suggests that someone yet lives here.
		
		The other landmark is a copse of gnarled trees, their silhouettes grasping like withered claws at the ruddy horizon.*

		||
		*As the Self walks towards the residence, the grass takes on a sweeter smell, its heavy mineral content dissipating. The fire within seems warm and inviting, and the smell of freshly baked bread wafts from the subtly smoking stack poking through the thatch. Casting a gaze back to the plain, the Self can find no trace of the gnarled copse. It is as if it were a mere phantasm of the mind, a trick of time and memory's conspiracy. The Self then continues onward toward the farmstead.*

		*The environs within are not at all reflective of the dilapidated exterior. The home is vibrant with life, richly decorated with paintings and tapestries hanging upon plastered walls. The window here displays a landscape in defiance of the one immediately behind the Self. The fields here are golden, shining in the light of a yellow sun as it sets into a bed of tangerine clouds on the horizon.
		
		The occupants move busily; children set the dining table while the wife is occupied with the preparation of the evening meal - roasted hen, peppers and some sort of gravy from the smell of it. A farmer of middle years emerges into the scene, wiping the water from his dripping face and hands. He smiles as the children rush over to him. None seem to have taken any notice of the Self.*

		Instead, the hail is answered by a presence standing immediately behind. Someone has followed the Self into this place from the plain outside...*

It sees the wife turn to present her family with a loaf of bread the color of aged rust. All attention is focused on the bounty of their farm, and the Self's intrusion goes unnoticed.
		
		The front door slams shut, breaking the spell. Whirling around, the Self sees not the ubiquitous family at their table, but rather a shadowy figure filling the doorway...*

		*At first, gleaming eyes are the only thing the Self can perceive. It can feel them piercing through consciousness in an act of violent thought that cleaves the mind asunder. Yet, in this place, these eyes neither have power to rend their prey nor conceal their nature.
		
		Soon, the form that holds these terrible eyes comes into focus. A wide-brimmed hat shrouds the features of a man dressed for a long journey, his cloak a patchwork of red cloth over layers of rusty fabric. His eyes dart towards the family before peering into the Self once more.*

		*The family sits down and breaks bread. As they begin to feast, a curious change begins to take place. The light outside begins to dim with unnatural swiftness. The fire in the hearth begins to quell, as though the air were being siphoned away. Soon, the family is dining by the amber light of candles alone.
		
		It is the younger ones that begin to succumb first. Whimpering into their bowls of stew and clutching their crusts in white-knuckled balls. They are driven on to eat by the harsh commands of the father and the gentle goading of the mother.
		
		Before long, the meek cries are choked sobs as they are overcome with fits of violent coughing. When the children have breathed their last, the couple are left to sit in silence. The father finally turns and stares into the eyes of the Self. Before his expression can register, the wife blows out the candles, and they are all plunged into utter darkness.*

		*The Self calmly casts its gaze all about, slowly illuminating the environs with the force of will. But the scene is not as it had been moments ago. Now the inside of the house mirrors the dilapidation and ruin of the outside. The table has long since been overturned and the house despoiled in either an act of panic or theft. No trace remains of the farmer couple or their children. However, Famlicus is still present, silhouetted against the window by a waxing pale light.
		
		Walking towards the pane, the Self sees that a single light shines in the velvet curtain of sky. A diminutive star pierces the darkness, but its light is cold and unwavering. The shimmering fields of red grass that stretch out into the horizon like an endless pool of blood. They neither cast shadows, nor reflect any light from the solitary celestial body. It is almost as if the star emanates not light, but awareness itself.*

		*As the Self walks towards the stand of trees, man's meddling hand becomes apparent. These long-dead redwoods had been grown and cultivated to form concentric circles. They give the illusion of emanating as pulses from a rough-hewn stone placed at the center. Casting a gaze back to the plain, the Self finds no trace of the farmstead.

It is only upon reaching them that it finally perceives what was there all along, hidden in plain sight; a bird-like specter roosts among the ghoulish tree limbs. Though its wide-brimmed hat and red cloak clothe a form seemingly human, it looks to be carved from a block of iron rust. Two glaring, ruby eyes stare out from above a cruelly-hooked beak.*

Yet, the peace of death seems comforting, as does the avian creature that circles overhead its trapped shell. While the wide-brimmed hat the creature dons does not permit a view of the its face, the purpose of its taloned hand is clear...

The awareness burns away all doubt and renders the path transparent, even as the razor edges that threaten to cleave flesh and soul block out what remains of the world without.

		*The Self awakens from the dream. It tries to remember. As far as it can tell, the world simply melted away. Shapes faded. Senses waned. Colors unified. Then, only oblivion remained.
		
		But the nothingness soon gives way to form. The mind's eye sees the darkness, inverting it. Dark becomes light; opaque becomes clear; and the Self begins to perceive shadows. As it reaches out to these apparitions, they gain in clarity. Their edges leak out, staining the surroundings, casting everything but the shadows themselves in a uniform grayness.
		
		The Self then begins walking, its footless steps silently falling upon a dull surface. The surrounding space and its identical hue, crack open as a distant horizon becomes barely perceptible. The steps continue their muted march.
		
		In the space of a thought, the Self has reached the distant horizon. Shapes begin to distinguish themselves from the ether, and soon enough, blurred forms and amorphous masses abound. After some time, the Self recognizes these shapes as trees.*

		*One step after another brings the Self into a space finally free of treacherous glass. The darkness gives way to an illumination of the mind and it is then that the Self sees before it the twisting halls of Mimir.
		
		The paths here are entirely comprised of carved wood panels. Each one of these richly detailed compositions bears a depiction of some event, though their relationship is rendered obscure by their seemingly random arrangement. Stunning visions of natural beauty are followed by hideous scenes of battle. Varnished woodcuts of humans engaged in endeavors of agriculture, art and leisure are celebrated alongside landscapes of strange vistas, so alien in their features that they look to have been born from dreams. While these fantastic environs were clearly not crafted in its honor nor by its hands, the Self feels an undeniable familiarity with these passages.*

		*As the ringing clang of metal on metal becomes louder and clearer, the Self is plunged into a space that can only be defined as a symmetry incarnate. The fine wood carvings have given way to strong beams of oak supporting walls of precisely cut black granite. The chamber is octagonal in its floor plan, but the ceiling is a multi-faceted dome, though no trace of curve or roundness disturbs the perfect angularity of these surroundings. The source of the clamoring noise stands at the room's center.
		
		A man of middling years works before an anvil in what is evidently a smithy. His curly hair is the color of unworked iron, while his muscles are taut, and twist with each blow in sublime perfection. The regularity of his strikes are matched by the breathing of the bellows as they are driven by a waterwheel emerging from the wall, of which only one third can be seen. With a pair of tongs, he draws a glowing blue substance from the furnace beside him, and with a hammer beats it into the material he is working. It seems he might be crafting the face of a young woman, though it is too unfinished to determine its identity.
		
		While the chamber and the smith reflect an uncompromising sense of order, the room is filled to bursting with myriad shapes and figures of varied design and material.*

Stacks of papers and tomes are kept in place by strange paperweights, including the brass statue of a multi-faceted male, a model tower fashioned from garnet and a bisected wolf skull, complete with brain and pulsating veins, staining the pages beneath with black blood.

		*Walking through this space reveals a path more resembling a tunnel than a corridor. The cylindrical passage twists and winds, the way only made evident by the burgeoning scent of life. The Self moves forward and onward until the path terminates in an ovoid chamber. While there is a flat surface upon which to stand, it is difficult to imagine what purpose this oblong room might have. Lining the curved wall are a number of alcoves. There seems to be some hidden organization to them that speaks its order only indirectly, permitting the awareness that they are divided into new and old.
		
		Walking through the chamber, the Self can sense a mixture of scents. Some of them are sweet and delightful, others are earthen or briny. Still others inspire revulsion. Lacing them all is a vapor of absence, which seem to divide the sensations from one another.*

So titanic are the dimensions of this life-form that they defy all sense of logic, with a circumference that would likely take a day's travel to explore. With a height of equal proportion no limbs are visible here, though the shadows of the distant canopy lie thick upon the moss-covered roots that stretch out in all directions.
		
		The waterfall the Self had followed to the bottom crashes down and unfolds as a fine mist, feeding a plethora of ferns and creeping vines that cover the entire area with a teeming presence of life. This verdant land is broken only by a dark well of water whose stillness belies depth far beyond this surface. The smell of green renders the air sweet, as though merely breathing it were nourishing.
		
		Yet, for all the life that such a place could afford, there seems to be but one creature calling this place home. While the skin of his wizened face is a hue matching the moss upon which he reclines, there can be no doubt that the Self looks upon the form of Vanargand.*

The sight of the trees is carried away on the wind as if they were no more substantial than the vapors that swirl about them. Emerging from the fog are looming shapes all about; these then shapes coalesce into stone walls.
		
		Looking down, the Self sees tiles hidden under the foliage beneath its feet. It knows this place. It is the Awakening Chamber where Eidos first gained consciousness. The fragments of the structure give the appearance of a ruin, yet there are no signs of cracks or weather wear. It is as if the Self looked upon the shards of a living mirror.*

		The crow alights upon a bone-white branch, and the Self sees that it and the bird are the only living things in sight.
		
		Abruptly, the crow begins driving its beak into its own abdomen, ripping black feathers and chunks of skin and gore into the air. Blood drips from the carrion bird upon the ground. A crimson pool in a field of bones. The pool expands towards the Self.
		
		Looking into the sanguine fluid, it sees not blood, but a black pit, a chasm that descends into the earth. In the space of a thought, the ground gives way beneath it and the Self plummets into the abyss.*
