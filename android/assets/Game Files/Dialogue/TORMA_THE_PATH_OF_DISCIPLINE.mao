For one, not a single branch sprouts from among the trees. Their countless trunks also all seem to share a bizarrely squarish aspect.*

		*Courage, hidden in the depths of his Trueflesh, seems to propel him through the portal. Yet, it seems less like him walking through it and more like it walking through him. As that shimmering gate absorbs his Falseflesh, the room transforms around him, massive black panels now starting to blanket the ceiling where only rough, rocky surfaces once were. People zip by as Ormenos remains static, nearly frozen in time. The panels flicker on and off, displaying images too quickly for the mage to interpret.
		
		But soon, the many people become fewer; the lights flicker less and less; and finally no movement, no light at all. In a state near either sleep or death, the room awaits - the object of its waiting uncertain.*

		*In the stationary silence, Ormenos has time to reflect on what he just witnessed. The effect is much greater, much wider-reaching even, than a simple change of decorations. No, it more closely resembles watching a boy become a man, seeing a blossom become fruit. It is seeing latent potential finally realized. This is the final stage, the inevitable outcome of the myriad chance encounters that led the mage here.*

		*Winking into consciousness, Ormenos now notes the presence of a silver throne at the center - the inevitable fixture in all Vanquished ruins.

But a more pressing issue pries his thoughts away from his answerless questions: someone seems to have already be occupying this throne.*

Shivering in his mage's robes, he waits to hear the inevitable collision and obliteration of the stone upon the surface of the dome. But his expectations remain unrequited.*

The newly threatened mage now likewise cowers in fear until the boulder stops before him, too. Then, similarly motivated by vengeance or shame, he propels the boulder back towards his assailant.*

		*As Ormenos enters this chamber of the labyrinthine Path, he sees spread out upon the floor a carpet of intricate weave, covered in an array of supple velvet pillows. Fatigue overwhelms reason, carrying him as of habit to rest a spell upon the mess of cushions.
		
		But there is no rest for the weary, as the now familiar whir acts as a prelude to the Arbiter's voice.*

		*In an instant, the intricately woven carpet unravels, revealing a diminutive clone beneath, barely wider than Ormenos is tall. The pillows wither into dying memories, leaving scarcely an impression behind. The smaller carpet soon begins to levitate, elevating Ormenos with it. A hole in the floor opens beneath, allowing passage down into the chamber below. In the space of a thought, the carpet and its cargo descend.*

HUBRIS' DEMISE
?[/ENCLAVE!THE PATH OF DISCIPLINE!HUBRIS' DEMISE!0.000!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*Floating gently down through the ground, carpet and all, Ormenos emerges in a chamber, flooded below by water and above by light. Slowly the carpet carries its passenger toward the mellow waves, stopping roughly twice the mage's height from the water's shimmering surface. He scans the surroundings, seeking an appropriate place to alight. His eyes almost immediately fall upon the unusual sight of a wide river traveling upwards along the dome. At first he believes it to be a trick of vision, but as he traces it skywards, he confirms its gravity-defying climb, as well as it ultimate disappearance into a hole at the top.
		
		Soon, he has traversed the whole chamber with his exploratory gaze, finding no solid ground. Perhaps more troubling, though, is the conspicuous absence of Arbiter's resounding voice.*

Extracting a small stone replica of the Biracul, the handiwork of Cook Ding from the Refectory, he ceases his search. Though a gift rich in artistry, its purpose would best be served testing the proverbial waters. Thus, Ormenos launches it over the side of the carpet.*

		Suddenly, a dark whisper calls from the unplumbed depths of consciousness. Bloodlust. Destruction. A memory of green. And in a flash, the ancient Phrygian tale comes to Ormenos, fully formed. The connections, the details, everything is there as though it always had been. Yes, he remembers now. The Phrygian wisemen warned that a man who only has a hammer sees all problems as nails, but that a man who only has a sword has no such limitations...*

		From the Graylands emerges Luin, the blade of Vanargand. With a youthful laugh, Luin eviscerates the knot, unraveling it into myriad individual strings. Its task done, the ghelblade vanishes back whence it came, leaving in its wake an unsavory aftertaste of gore and violence.*

Wider, wider, ever-widening, the shimmering wound expands, revealing a passage to the final trial on the Path of Discipline. Abruptly, its dilation comes to a halt, grown now to be twice the mage's width and height.

		*Unflinching light locks all shadows in place. The world seems still, frozen, timeless. A feigned stillness, the mage muses, as his footsteps click on unyielding stone. His learning reminds him that sound would not be possible in a frozen world, nor would any motion be. Illusions are but shadows cast by fools facing away from the light. Odd how even the Biraculian tradition of mindless sheep espoused this belief. Oh, yes, Ormenos could still quote the Biraculian Verses. His father repeated one such verse with such frequency he practically owned it.*
