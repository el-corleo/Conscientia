		*Bones and sinew weave a new shell as they are rebuilt from the life-fire of the ether. Ormenos now stands upon a copper disk in a dusty chamber where he is confronted with the cold, glaring eyes of scores of Thiudan Neverborn. Though the Enclavean Brother has seen their ilk many times before, Ormenos remains unnerved by the motionless sentries. Their scores of lines seem to fade away, gobbled up by the impenetrable murk at their backs.*

		*Turning around, Ormenos soon sees the lone rebel in this pit of darkness, the sole source of pale, pulsating light in this ruinous abyss. He sees the roots of a massive Muninn. Its determined glow radiates out into the inky void, slowly dying the further it ventures from the origin. The trunk reaches skyward, likewise disappearing somewhere in this sea of absence.

        The tree's light also falls on the miscellany of this space. Illuminating relics from the exodus of Thiuda as they lay scattered about, three to every Neverborn at least. Some on desks equally ancient, others on shelves, and still some too large to be housed in any casing.
		
		Though numerous the relics may be, only two objects truly tug at Ormenos' attention. One is a judgment dais, similar to the one in the Hall of Reckoning, he notes, with the only difference being the charred circle decorating its base - shadows they cannot be, for the neither hum nor buzz when the Muninn's light wavers. The second is simpler, and perhaps less grim: an altar, with several lit candles atop it.*

		*A blinding light cascades down from the ceiling, showering his form in rays of the purest white and forcing the sharpness of surrounding objects far into the shadowy background. He now sees nothing but the pillar of light in which he stands. He brings his hands up to his eyes, yet even they are invisible to him. Closer, closer, ever-closer, he keeps halving the distance, over and over, yet never reaching his face.*

Blood evaporates instantly upon contact with the air. Muscles begin to melt and bones dissolve, yet somehow he feels no pain - a small mercy.*

		*The cheerful mage reaches the Crypt of the Archons right as he finishes whistling the tune for the hundredth time - or was it the thousandth? In any event, it took him a long time to go a short way. In that time, he had many adventures, like when he slayed a cavern full of gremlins, or when he got Roostor drunk - not a good idea to get a god drunk, as it turns out! But time has come for him to return to the Enclave. To return to... by Roostor's comb! He's gotta fulfill his dream of caring for a herd of cows and become a cowherd! Oh, wait, not that... The word is 'coward'. He's gotta become a coward! In 3... 2... 1...*

		*Cautiously, Ormenos approaches the strange altar. Six digits rise skyward from the a giant palm of solid onyx, curving inwards at their tips. Cloudy jade fingernails each host candles burning with undying and unflinching flames. Red wax flows down the nails' gentle slopes, dripping towards the palm, but vanishing before ever reaching it.
		
		Just who or what this altar venerates is uncertain, but whatever the object of worship may be, it was likely invaluable to the Order's Thiudan ancestors. The very fact that any religious rites or altars exist in their fiercely materialistic civilization speaks volumes to how highly they must have valued it.*

Though originally invisible to Ormenos, from this very specific perspective it welcomes sight. The inquisitive mage briefly forgets his apprehension and leans in to examine it more closely. It is a memory crystal, raw and incompatible with a Muninn. He would need a Vanquished reading device to decipher its contents, a device only the grovekeepers guard jealously...*

        *Yet, something is different... something strange. A presence, a force, some beastly creature within him hungers. On the brink of starvation he feels like screaming, like howling. He longs to absorb the crystal's essence right into his Trueflesh. He yearns to forget the pain of this hunger, though he knows this will not cure it. Only one prey will sate him, but until then, this meager meal will have to suffice.*

		*From the depths of the Graylands a Glyph materializes. Gracefully loping from the shadows into the forefront of awareness, Ormenos recognizes the Glyph of Extraction made form. The fog seems to coalesce into memory, bringing with it awareness. Though he knows not why, Ormenos remembers Fenrir; he remembers their pact, made in forgotten eras with characters beyond Ormenos' ken. Fenrir has come to honor their covenant by consuming the crystal's energy and leaving bare its contents.*

		*Ormenos turns his attention once more to the adumbral chamber. Eyes immediately search for the ruby he emptied. Its memories resonate with his Trueflesh, sympathetic threads whispering across the fabric of time.
		
		But as attractive as the familiar may be, what is already known holds little sway over the inquisitive mage's attention. Discipline will help light his path through the shadows of ignorance; Discipline will wring knowledge from those who seek to cast shadows; Discipline will free Ormenos from fear... This has always been his hope.*

		Though numerous the relics may be, only two objects truly tug at Ormenos' attention. One is a judgment dais, similar to the one in the Hall of Reckoning, he notes, with the only difference being the circle of bones decorating this one's base. The second is simpler, and perhaps less grim: an altar, with several lit candles atop it.*

		*Ormenos squints as tears blur his vision. Entering the grove from the darkness of the halls is no less than stepping into a midday summer from a wintry midnight. Light burns his eyes, tormenting him like an unwanted truth. Myriad crystals here ensure that light is in no short supply, as they droop from Huginn branches like ripened fruits. But where there is light there are also shadows, the ever-present promise that the light will wane. The shadows shift, however, with the movement of crystals being carefully transported between the trees.*

Several thousands of stories compose this cyclopean structure, rings spiraling around a void pillar. From above, light cascades in through a massive aperture to the midday sky. Myriad rooms are carved into the rocky skin of the mountain's interior as they impertinently climb heaven-bound, ever-reaching for the heights the Vanquished once soared.
		
		At the center stands a Muninn tree, perhaps larger than all other Muninns combined. Its knotted, pearlescent branches reach forth from a mighty trunk, yearning for and growing towards the white crystals dotting the rooms along the walls.
		
		Rippling forth from its base are concentric rows of tables filled with scores of scholarly magi, studying, researching, ever-chasing the shadows of ignorance from their minds with the torch of Discipline.*

		*This great wooden spine of the Mathetia is ancient beyond measure, predating the Order itself. The thought sparks another; Ormenos recalls a theory he once heard that it may have been the original Muninn. It appears that many magi came to believe it simply on the strength of this being the only living Muninn of with no connection to a Thought Wheel. Centuries later, news came from Kabu that a method to cultivate Muninns independent of Thought Wheels did in fact exist. The theory fell into the mire of failed thoughts, its author's name along with it.*

        *His mind and feet continue to meander, slowly spiraling in towards the great white trunk and its forgotten past. Soon he finds himself circling the Muninn, caught in its invisible vortex. Closer, closer, ever closer he falls, in towards the giant's center. Round and round he goes, soon brushing up against the dark iron railing surrounding the tree. The body's fear instinctively draws eyes to the bottomless chasm the other side of the railing, that mysterious pit housing the Muninn's roots. All attempts to plumb its depths are always just rewarded with death and confusion. A stone dropped into the darkness will make no sound upon hitting the bottom - if it ever does. Even the Muninn's ghostly light eventually succumbs to the abyss' appetite...*

		As a Thought-Weaver, Ormenos regularly haunts the Vault down in the Third Sphere, but many moons ago when he had first arrived, he would spend countless hours in these Archives, devouring the knowledge his predecessors had left. Indeed, he cannot help but feel a small bout of nostalgia creep up on him as he decides where to direct his feet.*

		*The dank stench of stale air in the Archive corridors fades to forget as Ormenos steps into the shadowless Muninn Grove. Lights from myriad crystal arrays cast the surroundings in a perpetual daylight, crisply illuminating all objects from all angles.	The massive chamber gradually slopes downward, deep into the mountain's bowels, trees filling every last nook and cranny all the way to the area's invisible limits. Muninn limbs stretch across the ceiling and all along the walls, ever-searching for space to accommodate their expanding contents.*

		*Many junior Archivists hustle about, busy at work, often tending to saplings or arranging crystalline arrays to direct their growth. The more senior Archivists likewise sweat over their labors, sharing memories to slake the larger Muninns' thirsts for information. Recorded thought abounds within the network of Muninns, enough to make the stars seem countable. Not even centuries of Archivist delving has revealed more than a pitiful fraction of the memories predating the Order. The impossibility of the task winds a bitter smirk into Ormenos' face, lifting lip edges ever so slightly skyward. These curls begin to spiral in on themselves as his mind wanders to the Thought Wheel of the Beginning. Its contents will make this grove seem a hair to a mane; even if everyone everywhere became an Archivist, an eternity would still leave some thoughts undiscovered in its depths.*

Something about a man condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain path, only to always have it roll back down. In the witch's story it was designed to warn of obsession with hopeless tasks, though Ormenos always found an ineffable nobility in the project - then again, perhaps Sister Gate Keeper was right, that madness was simply beginning to sequester his wits; he dared not dwell too long on the possibility.*

His sympathy is short-lived, thwarted by a lifetime of indirect bird slaughter.*

		*Many junior Archivists bustle about, busy at work, often tending to saplings or arranging crystalline arrays to direct their growth. The more senior Archivists likewise sweat over their labors, sharing memories to slake the larger Muninns' thirsts for information. Recorded thought abounds within the network of Muninns, enough to make the stars seem countable. Not even centuries of Archivist delving has revealed more than a pitiful fraction of the memories predating the Order. The impossibility of the task winds a bitter smirk into Ormenos' face, lifting lip edges ever so slightly skyward. These curls begin to spiral in on themselves as his mind wanders to the Thought Wheel of the Beginning. Its contents will make this grove seem a hair to a mane; even if everyone everywhere became an Archivist, an eternity would still leave some thoughts undiscovered in its depths.*

        *Ormenos muses on his musings, remembering the tale the Sumarkandian witch from the reports on the Wayfarer. Something about a man condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain path, only to always have it roll back down. In the witch's story it was designed to warn of obsession with hopeless tasks, though Ormenos always found an ineffable nobility in the project - then again, perhaps Sister Gate Keeper was right, that madness was simply beginning to sequester his wits; he dared not dwell too long on the possibility.*

		*A blanket of dust rests thick upon all the forgotten residents of this vast chamber, all tucked in for their silent slumber. At the far end, bronze braziers burn tirelessly, casting a smoky wall of haze, nearly obscuring what lies beyond. Vague impressions do make their way through, though, revealing a natural spring cascading down from an outlet in the ceiling. Down it pours, pooling in a shallow well, then bisecting the room as it makes it way to some unseen point of egress. These pristine waters feed a luscious and overgrown garden beyond the smoky wall, only visible due to the several brilliant crystals illuminating the flora with their ghoulish golden glow.*

The ancient societies to whom these objects once belonged birthed the magnificent Huginn and Muninn groves; their wisdom gave rise to the Path of Discipline; their diligence amassed the innumerable volumes which line the Great Spiral Path in the Mathetia. And yet here it all lies, in forget's embrace.*

		*Light itself seems to have forsaken this place. A mere ten steps down a dubious spiral of stairs and shadows already blanket everything, thick and absolute like an inverse blizzard. Yet still he descends, each footfall carefully silenced. Though vision fails him, his ears help pick out the dimensions of the passage. Drops of condensation pour a periodic rain, slicking the steps and walls. Their echoes talk to the mage's ears, eager to reveal gossip not oft heard. It appears the passage is far wider than necessary to accommodate a single mage - likely, five linked arm in arm would not want for room - and far taller than the discretion required for a secret passage. But even still, Ormenos sticks close to the wall, fingers sliding along the damp stones.*

		*Light seems to have forgotten this place. It is a mere ten steps down a dubious spiral of stairs and shadows already blanket everything, thick and absolute like an inverse blizzard. Yet still Ormenos descends, following the faint footfalls Babel leaves to guide him. Though vision fails here, sound helps pick out the dimensions of the passage. In addition to the rhythmic sounds of their feet, drops of condensation pour a periodic rain, slicking the steps and walls. Their echoes talk to the mage's ears, eager to reveal gossip not oft heard. It appears the passage is far wider than necessary to accommodate the two magi - likely, five linked arm in arm would not want for room - and far taller than the discretion required for a secret passage. But even still, Ormenos sticks close to the wall, fingers sliding along the damp stones, chasing after his invisible leader.*

A persistent sense of dread tears at the tattered frays of his sanity, threatening to pull him under. But he is used to this by now. He can beat it; he must persevere. A derisive smirk curls Babels lips as he motions with his head to look again at the room.*
