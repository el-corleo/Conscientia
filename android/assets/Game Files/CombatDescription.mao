BOOK OF EIDOS
MAIN CHARACTERS
khaa
[/3]
	*2:
	The verdant glow of Luin's blade fills her vision as Eidos draws it forth to dispatch the mage, but soon finds herself nearly blind with pain. It is as if her temples were being assaulted by knives of white hot fire. 
	
	She can do nothing as Khaa casually walks forward while producing a knife, this one quite real, from his robes. He smiles contemptuously as he draws a matching grin across her throat with his blade...2*
	*3:
	Eidos moves to attack Khaa, but soon finds herself nearly blind with pain. It is as if her temples were being assaulted by knives of white hot fire. 
	
	She can do nothing as Khaa casually walks forward while producing a knife, this one quite real, from his robes. He smiles contemptuously as he draws a matching grin across her throat with his blade...
	
	His smile fades as Eidos feels her skin harden and crystallize against the knife edge. Using the moment of confusion, she grips his wrinkled throat in one hand and drives diamond-hard knuckles into his face with the other. 
	
	As his teeth fall from his jaw, so too does whatever hold over her mind he once held. Within moments, Khaa lies dead upon the ground, his head stove in by Eidos' bloody fist.3*	
	*14:
	Eidos feels her temples burn in pain as Khaa calls forth Glyphs to dissect her will and memory. As she sends forth the Glyph of Corruption in her counterstroke, the mage's eyes narrow in seeming recognition. 
	
	It seems as if his Glyphs of control act as a conduit through which Eidos can perceive the agony beginning to wrack his body, as though his very blood were boiling. 
	
	Khaa opens his mouth to scream but all that comes forth is a torrent of blood and gore as he begins vomiting up his liquefying organs. 
	
	Eidos is released from his hold when she finally feels Glyphs dissolve along with what remains of her victim's brain.14*

	Eidos moves to attack Khaa, but soon finds herself nearly blind with pain. It is as if her temples were being assaulted by knives of white hot fire. 
	
	She can do nothing as Khaa casually summons forth an immolating Glyph. Beads of sweat form upon her brow and her temperature steadily rises, rises, soars. Suddenly, she feels all the organs in her body simultaneously ignite turning her into a human torch while her ghost is burned out of her.@

babel
[/11]
	*2:
	As if in a dream, Ormenos summons from the Graylands the ghelblade Luin. When he acquired such offensive power was beyond his reckoning; that he had, though, brought great peace to his mind. This legendary blade was said to cut through even black crystals, the hardest known structures to the Vanquished. And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces.

	Yet what seems too good to be true, often is. For the youthful Babel is not without his defenses.

	Seemingly separating into dozens of different identical Falsefleshes, Babel confuses the blade of Vanargand momentarily. Is this a trick of the mind? To Ormenos' knowledge physical replication was an art forbidden by the Vanquished, but embraced by the Thiuda. However, it has been lost for centuries and not even at its acme was it ever capable of reproducing complex objects, let alone humans.

	As Ormenos ponders this senseless trivia, Luin has already begun to attack the mage's scapegoats. Yet, what ultimately happens is unclear, for all Ormenos remembers before the world fades from existence is a single word.

	"Dream."2*
	*3:
	As if in a dream, Ormenos summons from the Graylands the ghelblade Luin. When he acquired such offensive power was beyond his reckoning; that he had, though, brought great peace to his mind. This entity now envelops Ormenos' Falseflesh, protecting him from all external blows. And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces.

	"Dream."3*
	*14:
	Images of warping and putrefaction come to Ormenos' mind as of instinct. He visualizes the rotting innards of his current foe, attempting to manifest his desires beyond the jurisdiction of the Graylands.

	And the mage standing before him, collapses into a writhing pile of grayish fluid. It screams in agony, whipping to and fro; then it laughs maniacally, only to start bubbling.

	Yet, what ultimately happens is unclear, for all Ormenos remembers before the world fades from existence is a single word.

	"Dream."14*
	@
	With nothing but rage as his weapon, Ormenos flings himself at Babel in a vain attempt to end the young mage. To his chagrin, it is only his own end which he elicits.

	Ormenos swings wildly at the illusory form of Babel only to find himself falling right through the projection. Yet, what ultimately happens is unclear, for all Ormenos remembers before the world fades from existence is a single word.

adarin
[/12]
	*1:
	Eidos closes distance and strikes Adarin with her bare fists. The blow knocks him to the cold cave floor. Equally cold blue eyes stare at Eidos lacking all emotion as she mounts her victim's chest and slams her palm into the bridge of his nose. 
	
	The former mage makes no attempts to defend himself as she grabs his head and bashes it continuously against the rocky floor of the stone. Black blood begins to pool and takes on a hue of crimson as it creeps into the shaft of light. 
	
	The killing at its end, the limp, lifeless body is all that remains of Adarin.1*
	*2:
	Eidos draws back Luin to strike. Her feint to his head before thrusting into his heart is unnecessary, as Adarin makes no effort to defend himself. 
	
	The hermit only utters a soft involuntary moan as his lungs are deflated when Luin is drawn from the gaping wound.
	
	The killing at its end, the limp, lifeless body is all that remains of Adarin.2*
	*3:
	Eidos' skin hardens like diamond before impacting the skull of Adarin. The shock wave liquefies his brain killing him instantly. 
	
	The killing at its end, the limp, lifeless body is all that remains of Adarin, the Beast Lord. He offered no resistance and thus his blood sours Luin's tongue.3* 
	*14:
	Adarin makes no move to defend himself as Eidos instinctively conjures up the Glyph of Corruption. His face remaining a stoic mask, she can only imagine the hermit's agony as his skin begins to dissolve until it has melted away, leaving a steaming lump of amorphous flesh.14*
	@ADARIN WILL NOT FIGHT BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES@

pakahron
[/13]
	*14:
	Eidos can immediately feel Pakahron's mind calling forth multiple Glyphs. As though through instinct, her thoughts immediately project the Glyph of Corruption. Whatever phrases of destructive Techne the mage may have been calling forth are abruptly halted by putrefaction sweeping through his brain. 
	
	The form that shapes the fabric of his physical being is unraveled until his body is transformed into a self-annihilating plasma, consuming him from the inside out.14*
	@
	Eidos prepares to strike only to feel as though her insides were crawling. She tears open her robe to see the skin of her belly dissolve, unleashing the liquefying contents of her abdomen. 
	
	Collapsing in a puddle of toxic plasma, Eidos glares up at her slayer. Her final view is of a barely perceptible smirk that passes across Pakahron's staring countenance as he witnesses Eidos' melting from within.@
[13/]

khlutt
[/14]
	*14:
	Khlutt's mind reaches forth to dull Eidos' reflexes, as he loads up a strike to her face. As the center of his body unwinds to release the blow, the fibers of muscle that drive his motion unravel and are putrefied by the Glyph of Corruption. 
	
	His misdirected momentum casts his body to the floor, landing with a sickening splatter of bone-eating plasma. The Glyph he had conjured dissipates and Eidos is free to witness the spasming heap of melting flesh that was once such a formidable physical force quickly dissolve into nothing.14*
	@
	A Glyph appears beneath her, its blazing dark fire carving a void into the floor. Her memory of the Glyphs seems to flicker and then vanish in an instant.
	
	Khlutt soon blitzes toward her with inhuman speed and soon is upon her. Desperation takes hold and Eidos throws her fists wildly at the advancing mage. But any and all attacks appear to be futile before him. He moves lithely, dodging every attack Eidos plans to use before she can even use it, his careful positioning and smooth footwork the cause.
	
	In a flash, he is behind her.
	
	A mind-numbing fear fills her, followed immediately by a searing pain as her vertebrae lacerate her spinal cord. She collapses to the ground and sees only Khlutt's foot descend upon her one last time before leaving her Falseflesh.@

rikharr
[/18]
	*--impossible to kill--*
	@
	Sensing Eidos' intent to slay their imprisoned charge, the Valvorthr swarm her and begin clawing at her flesh with their fossilized nails. 
	
	They rip with such speed, such ferocity, Eidos barely has a chance to feel pain before her very ability to stand is robbed from her as her tendons and ligaments snap like tightened strings.
	
	Rikharr looks upon Eidos knowingly. He fully expects her to return and she knows this. As the eyes of her Falseflesh fail from the repeated concussive force of her head's encounter with the stone floor, her ghost flees in search of its new shell.@

SANCTUARY
sanctuary sentry
[/49]
	*2:
	The sentry engages with a flurry of stabs, all invisible to Eidos. Yet she remains undamaged, as Luin, taking the form of a sword, has deflected all of the pinpoint strikes.
	
	Suddenly, a bloodlust wells up within her, almost certainly originating from her emerald ally. She leaps forward for a counter-offensive. The sentry, however, appears to have anticipated the strategy, already in a defensive stance, spear upraised, ready to block. Yet it blocks nothing as Luin cleaves, ripping through the spear and sentry alike, as though through empty space.
	
	A geyser of blue blood showers the surrounding bas reliefs, giving them a grim makeover.2*
	*3:
	The sentry engages with a flurry of stabs. Yet Eidos remains undamaged, as Luin, taking the form of armor, has deflected all of the pinpoint strikes. 
	
	Suddenly, Eidos feels a bloodlust well up within her, almost certainly originating from the green soul bound to her mind. This compels her to leap forward for a counter-offensive. The sentry, however, appears to be ready for this, adopting a defensive stance. 
	
	Yet Eidos still rushes forward, thrusting her hand through the spear and sentry, ripping out its innards and showering the hall in a geyser of blue blood.3*
	@
	Eidos runs in the direction of the sentry but only manages to impale herself on his spear. As she loses consciousness, the sentry drops her motionless body on the floor and brushes it aside with the butt of its spear before resuming its previous posture. 
	
	Beating this foe will require more than just bravado.@

DAZIR NPCs
doruk
[/50]
	*2:
	With a casual swing, Luin cuts the wizened skull from the aged man's shoulders as if it were a fresh dandelion's head. 
	
	Eidos can feel Luin's dissatisfaction with such fleeting trivialities.2*
	*3:
	Eidos telegraphs a low kick to Doruk's leg, which the old cocker attempts to thwart with his staff. Her shin easily breaks the stick and even more easily shatters the bone. 
	
	His wails of pain and mercy are silenced when she stomps his head like an overripe melon.3*
	*14:
	Doruk shrieks in agony as the Glyph of Corruption unravels the forms that bind his flesh, organs and bone together. He screams and screams, until his lungs are dissolved from within. 
	
	In but a few moments, what remains of the aged Daziran is barely recognizable as human.14*
	@
	Eidos' rush towards her prey is thwarted by a sound blow to the head from the old cocker's wooden staff. Blood leaks from her ear and a ringing sound consumes all of her hearing. 
	
	The piercing noise only halts when Doruk brings his stick down upon her once more...@

mert
[/51]
	*2:
	As Eidos draws forth Luin, a faint resonance can be heard drifting through the air. The Daziran's eyes widen in horror as the crystalline tone is joined in harmony by the sound of glass scraping on bone, signaling the blade's rough entrance into its victim's rib cage.
	
	A ragged exhalation serves as the song's cadence as Mert crumbles in a blood-soaked heap.2*
	*3:
	Luin's thirst for blood, now shared by Eidos, beckons for a Daziran sacrifice. Eidos, cripples her foe with kicks that smash his bones. 
	
	As he falls, Eidos brings her knee down upon his chest and bashes his head into a tonic to remedy her thirst.3*
	*14:
	Mert shrieks in agony as the Glyph of Corruption unravels the forms that bind his flesh, organs and bone together. He screams and screams, "Mert! Mert!! Meerrrt!!!," until his lungs are dissolved from within.

	Eidos draws Luin from the depths of the Graylands. They are one now: weapon and wielder. Both of them bound by a common purpose. 
	
	Rage. Joy. Hatred. Exhilaration. Disgust. Regret. Eidos feels all these emotions and more. Is it she or Luin that is the source of these feelings? Has she been robbed of her will? Is she a victim of her passions and not their master? 
	
	Looking down upon the sour expression of the lumpen face staring up at her, the torrent of emotion in her twined soul is centered, though by no means diminished, and all doubt is banished like mist in the sun by a clarion conviction: It does not matter. 
	
	Nothing matters now. Nothing but the fulfillment of their mission.
	
	And so it was that Eidos and Luin, Blade of Vanargand, destroyed Reba.2*
	*3:
	As Eidos loads up a mighty blow, Reba looks at her blankly with dull eyes. The fist comes speeding towards her ugly face, and the morose Tambulan Cultivator lacks either the reflexes or motivation to do anything about her impending doom. 
	
	Her head snaps violently backwards, mercifully ending the existence she cruelly inflicted upon the world.3*
	*14:
	Reba whimpers pathetically as the Glyph of Corruption takes hold. She moans and groans annoyingly, until her lungs are dissolved from within. 
	
	In but a few moments, what remains of the morose Tambulan is a bubbling, stinking mess. Finally, her physical form is truly reflective of her mental state.14*

	*2:
	Weak, weak, WEAK! Eidos feels Luin's frustration as it cleaves easily through the flesh of such hapless prey. It's as though the blood of Tambul were tainted by peace: the foulest of spices.2*
	*3:
	Without warning, Eidos seizes the head of the aged Tambulan and pulls it into her rising knee. The blow pulverizes the neck vertebrae, along with all her other osteoporosis-ridden bones, resounding with an audible pop, thus ending Enteghad's life immediately.3*
	*14:
	Enteghad's hands grip her wrinkly throat as the Glyph of Corruption takes hold. The scream that erupts from her pierces the dry air and is halted only when her mouth becomes filled with blood. 
	
	Crimson tears weeping from her glazed eyes, contorted ears and aquiline nose, the aged Tambulan casts herself to the dust, writhing about for only a second before all life has been snuffed, leaving a pile of flesh melting from ruddy bones.14*

logira

	*2:
	Drawing Luin, Eidos swings her glassy blade towards the Tacribian Librarian. Though, Eidos is surprised to strike nothing but air. The warrior draws a wide, curved sword and begins launching a flurry of attacks towards Eidos' face. She can barely keep pace with the barrage... 
	
	However, Luin seems more than up to the task. Having no choice, Eidos gives her free will up to her weapon. As soon as it is freed from her command, the sword immediately deflects an oncoming cut, turns over and slams itself through Logira's sternum.2*
	*3:
	Eidos swings her unbreakable fist towards the Librarian. Though, Eidos is surprised to strike nothing but air. The warrior draws a wide, curved sword and begins launching a flurry of attacks towards Eidos, though the blade leaves nary a scratch on her diamond-hard skin. 
	
	Eidos then easily seizes both her assailant's wrists and begins slamming her forehead into Logira's face. Soon, Eidos' quarry lies at her feet, groaning, bleeding and dying.3*
	*14:
	Logira clutches her abdomen in pain as the Glyph of Corruption takes hold in her form. She moves to strike at Eidos, but instead collapses on the ground, coughing up bile. 
	
	This bile gives way to blood, and the blood gives way to liquefied organs as the warrior is eaten from within by her self-annihilating plasma.14*
	@
	Before Eidos can make a motion, she sees that Logira has drawn a wide, curved sword from within the folds of her robe. With preternatural awareness, the Librarian steps away from the space where Eidos' blow will land and slices cleanly through her leg. 
	
	Eidos falls to the floor clutching her bleeding stump. She does not last in pain for long as Logira's next blow comes swiftly, striking her head from her shoulders as she lies helpless on the floor.@

	Awakened by this death, Luin's awareness fills Eidos just in time for her to deflect a lethal blow from the slain warrior's companion. The older man's emotions are unreadable behind a mask of intense concentration, though his intention is made clear in his every movement. Eidos fights in desperation for her life, losing ground with every breath. It is only when she gives her will over to Luin that the tide turns.
	
	Brimming with joy, the blade pulls Eidos into a reckless forward roll, swinging upwards and dividing the torso of its opponent in a vertical cut.2*
	*3:
	The Tacribian warriors deal countless cuts and thrusts to Eidos, in a flurry that would have ended her life many times over were it not for Luin's protection. When exhaustion begins to slow their movements, their attack becomes hampered further by bone-shattering blows. 
	
	And in mere moments it is over.3*
	*14:
	The muscles of the two warriors flex instinctively as a wave of agony ripples through their flesh. Their strength and training become meaningless as their bones, muscles and brains are assailed from within. They scream until their lungs collapse. They live until their hearts burst. They quiver until their very being is erased.14*
	@
	Assala knows that Eidos is no match for her, the smirk on her face makes that clear enough. But what's hidden behind the sparkle in her eyes is even more terrifying. Years of repression and pent up aggression are soon to be unleashed. 
	
	What follows can only be described as torture that was dreamed up by one unfit for society. (Perhaps that is why she is here and not back with her comrades?)
	
	Assala slices the tendons at Eidos' ankles, making her genuflect in an unintentional show of submission. Then Assala removes Eidos' arms, allowing the blood to leak from the roots they were once attached to. 
	
	It takes hours for Eidos to finish her excruciating journey from Falseflesh to true and back to her newest shell.@

	*3:
	With blinding speed, the bird-creatures raise their talons to strike Eidos. The razor-like claws strike green sparks from her skin, yet her armor's integrity holds and she feels no pain. Their attacks doing nothing to her. 
	
	Eidos closes distance through the flurry of strikes. With murderous intent, the two creatures leap upon her, dragging Eidos to the ground, tearing and biting at her flesh. Eidos feels a welling of anger building within her. Anger and something else. 
	
	As a clawed foot stamps her face down upon the ground, she feels a giddiness. A desire for freedom. As the hopelessness of her situation sets in, she gives herself over to this presence, the sleeping form of Luin.
	
	In the briefest of moments, the ghelblade abandons her skin and Luin arcs up through the bodies of the two creatures, dividing them in twain and splattering an azure fluid over her body.
	
	Eidos rises wearily to her feet and gazes upon the avian beings as their forms crumble away into piles of oxidized dust, then upon the quickly drying liquid that covers her body. She sees numerous gashes on her torso and feels a few more in her face. In the brief time of Luin's awakening, the talons punctured her flesh. 
	
	The green shimmer within her skin tells her that the weapon slumbers within her once more.3*

	Before her death, Eidos sees her attackers spit her blood and skin from their darkened mouths in disgust.2*

	The Valvorthr try to bite into Eidos' diamond hard skin only to have their rotten teeth shatter. They are not deterred. 
	
	With inhuman strength. They grab her by all four limbs and begin to stretch her to her limits. Then, they slowly begin lifting her above their heads, stopping at the zenith. At blinding speed they bring Eidos crashing to the ground knocking the wind out of her. They repeat the process several times, faster and faster each time. 
	
	To Eidos' dismay, Luin's impenetrable shield cannot keep her brain from getting concussed repeatedly. Eventually, her optic nerve severs and the pain from all the blunt force trauma only disappears as her ghost escapes her Falseflesh.3*
	*14:
	Eidos calls the Glyph of Corruption to mind, but she cannot direct it towards their Trueflesh. Then memory of the fact that draug and Unseen are immune to the effects of Techne hits her along with the first blows of the Valvorthr. 
	
	They do not stop beating her until her brain is a mushy pulp incapable of sustaining consciousness, upon which Eidos' ghost departs from her Falseflesh.14*

The intense heat boils away the air in the chamber, and soon, Eidos' movement is slowed to a crawl.

	Ark strides forth and the shape strides with her. Glyphs begin manifesting all about Eidos. From the very Graylands itself the Glyphs arise and Eidos finds all perception has become warped and twisted. Her heart slows, her breath shallows and her blood begins to freeze. As her vision darkens, all feeling and thought are annihilated. She is reduced to nothing until the only thing that remains is her death...
	
	But then, Luin comes from the inner recesses of Eidos' mind, as though of instinct, to strike his former companion through the heart. Death dealt without anger, without malice, this is the nature of the ghelblade Luin. Wielder of the past is not a title Luin recognizes, as it was never encoded into his being.
	
	Ark, shocked to see, much less be slain by her former sword, realizes what this means and who she is facing. She collapses, thus ending the battle.2*

	As if in a dream, Ormenos summons from the Graylands the ghelblade Luin. When he acquired such offensive power was beyond his reckoning; that he had, though, brought great peace to his mind. This legendary blade was said to cut through even black crystals, the hardest known structures to the Vanquished. And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces.
	
	Before the Beast Lord can react, his left arm is severed, though the wound is cauterized by the intense heat of the blade. Yet, he remains unfazed, coldly signaling the other enforcers begin their counterattack.
	
	Though immensely powerful and dexterous, Luin is not omnipotent. The ghelblade but slays several Enforcers before Ormenos is knocked unconscious from behind, casting the Graylands denizen back whence it came.2*

So overwhelmed is he that his psyche becomes crushed under the unbearable weight of awareness that his hands are tainted with the blood of innocent magi of his Order... There's no turning back now. All is lost. All is...3*
	*14:
	Images of warping and putrefaction come to Ormenos' mind as of instinct. He visualizes the rotting innards of his current foe, attempting to manifest his desires beyond the jurisdiction of the Graylands. The Beast Lord succumbs to these malignant machinations as his gut begins to dissolve, leaving a rather visual aperture in his viscera. And in the space of a thought, this threat is no more...
	
	Yet he was not alone, was he? And Ormenos has this epiphany as the world before his eyes begins to darken and fade into nothingness.14*

	Knowing absolutely nothing about combat, Techne-based or otherwise, Ormenos charges at the Enforcer in some vain attempt to strike him down. The understandably shocked Beast Lord simply side steps the brutish assault, causing the off-balanced Ormenos to go careening into the rather unforgiving rigidity of a wall.
	
	The Beast Lord now regaining his composure begins his counter-offensive against his dazed assailant. Before Ormenos can tell where he is being attacked from, a precisely landed strike causes the world around him to dim...@

In no conceivable reality would this ever be a viable attack strategy, yet it is all one uninitiated in the ways of combat could ever hope to achieve.

And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces... though as Ormenos thinks upon it, he realizes Brother Mind Seer poses no threat whatsoever, for if ever there were a meeker mage than himself, it would be the Mind Seer.
	
	However, unable to fully control the barbaric instincts of this living weapon, Ormenos cuts through the weak Falseflesh of his compatriot.

	Coming to his senses, Ormenos belts out a soul-wrenching cry. The weight of this decision wears heavy upon his soul. He has killed his Jeran Brother. His psyche splinters into a thousand pieces, carving the memory into his Trueflesh. Then, putting Luin to his throat, he threatens to end the life of this wretched beast he has become.

	In an fit of rage, both ineffable and incomprehensible to Ormenos, he strikes the Mind Seer, cutting his flesh open on his bony hands. As the Mind Seer bleeds and whimpers, Ormenos mercilessly bites into his throat, ripping off a chunk of veiny, pulsating meat straight from his neck. Incredulous, defenseless, and utterly powerless, the Mind Seer leaves his Falseflesh. His confused eyes stare at Ormenos, making their useless pleas as they glaze over.

	Conjuring the bellicose ghelblade from its restless wanderings in the Graylands, Ormenos performs the ironic service the universe craves by carving Cook Ding up into serviceable slabs of meat. The process takes but a moment, but then Luin devolves to its usual violence and continues to partition the cuts of meat into ever-smaller chunks until they become merely a primordial ooze of organic material.
	
	Ormenos looks upon the uncontrollable movement of his Falseflesh, horrified at the fate he has cursed upon his brother of the Enclave. However, the striking of his nape brings on the darkness of sleep and with it the surety that he will have the rest of time to atone for the evils he has thrust upon Cook Ding. Indeed, the Enforcers are upon him and take him and his waning consciousness to the Vault.2*

	@
	Though elderly and morbidly obese, Cook Ding is not without his battle wits... He raises his arms to protect his sensitive noggin from any errant fists the untrained Ormenos might throw. Then, he proceeds to belt out a raspy and grating whine, as loud as he can; for he knows he only need endure this abuse until the nearby Enforcers can reach the Refectory.
	
	His plan works flawlessly, in no small part due to how physically weak Ormenos is. The arrival of the Enforcers goes unnoticed by Ormenos for he can only tell indirectly that they have arrived when a precisely landed strike causes the world around him to dim...@

	All these thoughts are pushed aside as the verdant luster of the brilliant weapon becomes manifest in reality, understandably shocking all the Architects of the Huginn Grove.

	Pandemonium ensues, for a single life cannot sate the bloodlust of the blade of Vanargand! No, it is then that Luin proceeds to decimate the feeble Architects' ranks, slicing through one mage after another, leaving artistically arrayed dollops blood and nuggets of offal scattered in the six directions.

And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces.
	
	Unable to fully control the barbaric instincts of this living weapon, Ormenos cuts the Law Bringer down instantly. However, so enthralled is Ormenos with the primal violence of his actions that he fails to notice that he continues to flay lifeless lumps of flesh, spraying unnameable bodily fluids in the six directions. Though perhaps more alarming is that the other Enforcers who accompanied him spring into action.
	
	Though immensely powerful and dexterous, Luin is not omnipotent. The ghelblade looks to slay the other two Enforcers, but fails in the attempt as Ormenos' is struck on the nape with impressive force from behind. The world fades and Ormenos consciousness likewise wanes to nothingness.2*

	As if in a dream, Ormenos summons from the Graylands the ghelblade Luin. When he acquired such offensive power was beyond his reckoning; that he had, though, brought great peace to his mind. This entity now envelops Ormenos' Falseflesh, protecting him from all external blows. And, best of all, it moves of its own bloodlust, seeking to end the threat Ormenos now faces.
	
	Before the Law Bringer can react, Luin is upon him, bringing Ormenos' Falseflesh along for the ride. Yet, he remains unfazed, coldly following the well-rehearsed attack patterns with the other enforcers as they begin their counterattack.
	
	Though immensely powerful and dexterous, Luin is not omnipotent. The ghelblade looks to slay the Enforcer trio, but fails in the attempt as Ormenos is knocked down from behind. The trio then bind Ormenos and drag him off to meet his doom.3*
	*14:
	Images of warping and putrefaction come to Ormenos' mind as of instinct. He visualizes the rotting innards of his current foe, attempting to manifest his desires beyond the jurisdiction of the Graylands. The Law Bringer succumbs to these malignant machinations as his gut begins to dissolve, leaving a rather visual aperture in his viscera. And in the space of a thought, this threat is no more...
	
	Yet, despite his elation at overcoming this hurdle, his success is short-lived as the infelicitous call to action of the Enforcers accompanying the fallen mage seems to have escaped his notice. In truth, he can only tell indirectly that they took action when a precisely landed strike causes the world around him to dim...14*
	@
	Knowing absolutely nothing about combat, Techne-based or otherwise, Ormenos charges at the Enforcer in some vain attempt to strike him down. The understandably shocked Enforcer simply side steps the brutish assault, causing the off-balanced Ormenos to go careening into the rather unforgiving rigidity of a wall.
	
	The Law Bringer now regaining his composure begins his counter-offensive against his dazed assailant, his cronies chiming in with their deft movements, as though performing a symphony of pure and elegant violence. Before Ormenos can tell where he is being attacked from, a precisely landed strike causes the world around him to dim...@

	*2:
	Ormenos brings the Glyph of Luin to the forefront of his thoughts, now aware of his seemingly long-standing, inherited covenant with the ghelblade, though just when it was he learned the Glyph escapes his ken.
	
	All these thoughts are pushed aside as the verdant luster of the brilliant weapon becomes manifest in reality, understandably shocking all the magi in the Hall of Reckoning. Luin intuits his master's purpose and gleefully enacts what is willed. In the space of a thought, the Message Bearer has been shred to veritable ribbons with such speed and precision that no blood is drawn before the slices of Falseflesh separate and collapse to the ground.
	
	Pandemonium ensues, for a single life cannot sate the bloodlust of the blade of Vanargand! No, it is then that Luin proceeds to decimate the feeble magi's ranks, slicing through one mage after another, leaving artistically arrayed dollops blood and nuggets of offal scattered in the six directions. The entire spectrum of human emotion, all on display with magi running in terror, Luin slaying euphorically, Ormenos grieving at what he has done, plus the Enforcers awed and angered by the senseless slaughter of their comrades at Ormenos' hand.
	
	Luin shifts its attention to the tastier morsels that are the Enforcers, severing the leader's arm from her Falseflesh, though the wound is cauterized by the intense heat of the blade. Yet, she remains unfazed, coldly signaling the other enforcers begin their counterattack.
	
	Though immensely powerful and dexterous, Luin is not omnipotent. The ghelblade but slays several Enforcers before Ormenos is knocked unconscious from behind, casting the Graylands denizen back whence it came.2*

	Pandemonium ensues, for a single life cannot sate the bloodlust of the blade of Vanargand! No, it is then that Luin proceeds to decimate the feeble magi's ranks, smashing through one mage after another, cracking bones and ripping flesh, leaving artistically arrayed dollops blood and nuggets of offal scattered in the six directions. The entire spectrum of human emotion, all on display with magi running in terror, Luin slaying euphorically, Ormenos grieving at what he has done, and of course the Enforcers awed and angered by the senseless slaughter of their comrades at Ormenos' hand.
	
	Luin shifts its attention to the tastier morsels that are the Enforcers, Luin darts toward the leader, bringing Ormenos' Falseflesh along for the ride. Yet, the battle-hardened Enforcer remains unfazed, coldly signaling the other enforcers begin their counterattack as he evades blow after blow from Ormenos' guided limbs.
	
	Though immensely powerful and dexterous, Luin is not omnipotent. The ghelblade but slays several Enforcers before Ormenos is knocked down from behind, the remaining Enforcers then bind Ormenos and drag him off to meet his doom.
	
	Ormenos himself cannot believe that he has killed his brothers. What could have possessed him to take such actions? His mind spins with half-baked explanations and excuses for his actions. So overwhelmed is he that his psyche becomes crushed under the unbearable weight of awareness that his hands are tainted with the blood of innocent magi of his Order... There's no turning back now. All is lost. All is...3*
	*14:
	Ormenos conjures up the vilest imagery from the bubbling pits of chaos deep in the Graylands. He knows now that the Glyph of Corruption is responding to his call for smiting his enemies. What he does not realize is the unstoppable destructive quality of this Glyph, but this awareness now begins to dawn on him as the extent of its volatility becomes manifest.
	
	The Message Bearer begins to melt from inside out, the liquefied remains of her organs spilling out as her abdominal cavity becomes expose for all to see. The excruciating pain she suffers from this soul-wrenching Techne cause her to left out blood-curdling cries of agony until the bottom of her lungs melt into a fetid goo. Her cries, now voiceless yet equally disturbing, understandably shock all the Architects of the Huginn Grove. In the space of a thought, what the Form Forger has now become is no more than a nameless ooze.
	
	Pandemonium ensues, for Ormenos, as of instinct, begins casting his disintegrating Techne hither, thither and yon, felling mage after feeble mage. The entire spectrum of human emotion, all on display with magi running in terror, the Corruption's ambivalent destruction, Ormenos grieving at what he has done, and the newly arrived Enforcers awed and angered by the senseless slaughter of their comrades at Ormenos' hand.
	
	In truth, Ormenos can only tell indirectly that they arrived when a precisely landed strike causes the world around him to dim...14*
	@
	The impotent and unarmed Ormenos violently casts his weak punch at his equally feeble opponent. They pinch and pull each other's hair. The weakly poking each other's eyes. Yet no damage seems to occur on either side of this meek battle (?) and there are no signs that it will result in a clear victor - though both clearly appear to be losing.
	
	Then something snaps in Ormenos' mind as he is reminded of his command to destroy his chosen target and he bites solidly into the Form Forger's jugular, causing a spectacular fountain of blood to erupt from her neck. Yet, before the blood can even splash back down on the floor, Ormenos is kicked in the nape and sent to the realms of sleep.@
